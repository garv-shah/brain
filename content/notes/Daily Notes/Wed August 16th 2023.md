Hi Everyone! My name's Garv and I'd like to be your House Captain for 2024, because how bad can I be? I've asked that question to myself a lot recently and I think it's a question that embodies Langley: how bad can I possibly be?

It's kind of crazy that I'm standing here right now, it felt like just yesterday that I was in Year 7, watching our soon to be House Captain, Steven, come and stand here with a guitar for his rendition of Baby by Justin Bieber. I asked him later why he wanted to be house captain, and he said "well, how bad could it really be?"

When I first joined the house, the sheer choice was *overwhelming*. There was so much to do, so much possibility, so I ended up doing what came naturally, I signed up to everything that I could, just to give it a shot. How bad can I be? Well, the answer is quite very bad, but honestly it didn't matter, I was having a blast while doing it. So many things just fell flat on their face, I think 90% of the things I've tried have just failed completely, but I kept going because it's what felt natural to me. 

When I imagine Langley House, I think of one word. Perseverance. We're the loudest and proudest house, and we'll give anything a shot, because at the end of the day, how bad can we be?? I know that I and all my fellow Langleyites will give it their all, that's just what we do. I want to be house captain because it feels natural to me, a natural continuation of how much I've received from this community and how much I wanna give back. I love this house, I love making an impact, and I love just giving things a shot. So why not? Give me a shot, because really, how bad can I be?
