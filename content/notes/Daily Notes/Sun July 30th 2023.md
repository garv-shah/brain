School leadership!

Personal brand is about how I genuinely find it really fun and enjoyable to help other people and school leadership is an opportunity to make a wider impact and have others realise their abilities
- talk about student mental health
- connection with other campuses
- connection with many facets of the school, bring together communities
- year levels working more with each other, after covid only gotten to know own year level, personally only gotten much closer to year level below me this year, could try to have more of that, maybe a buddy system with year 12s and 7s
