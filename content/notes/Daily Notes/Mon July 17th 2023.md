I'm in the city today! I got invited to [Tildes](https://tildes.net/) which is really cool and I've been having some fun with that. Right now I'm in the Melbourne Connect building and I'm meeting with [Prof Alistair Moffat](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/13222-alistair-moffat). 

## Questions for Mr. Moffat
Below are the main discussion points I want to have with him:
- Hi hello introduce myself, explain how I'm very interested in his work, namely on text retrieval systems and search engines. 
- Been studying Algorithmics at school, and I've worked on a lot of frontend programming for apps and such, but have recently gotten a lot more interested in the theoretical side of computer science from books and the internet.
- I could help with anything to do with actual programming, which I really enjoy and have experience with. I can also help with anything that's rather repetitive, I just simply want to be involved with and see how research it done at universities, since it a very different side to the field I am interested in that I haven't viewed before.
- My strengths lie in the actual programming itself, mainly frontend things so far, since I have made plenty of apps and websites for countless purposes. If anything like this is ever needed, especially with any of his PhD students, then I'd be incredibly pumped if I could have an informal assistant role with any of his students and see what I can help out with.

## Notes for Two Cousins
> These should be added into the issue tracker later

- the list of available jobs should also have a section underneath it, maybe a button that says view other jobs, and this section should list jobs that are free but that don‚Äôt match the availability of the user since some may have more flexible schedules. Also it is not immedietly clear that the cards are interactive/clickable, so there should be an indicator saying ‚Äú16 times available‚Äù to make that more clear.
- preferably once a lesson time slot is locked in, it should also display on the manage jobs card so that it‚Äôs more clear when the lesson is.
- volunteers should be able to click the start shift button up to 15 mins before the lesson has started, but logic needs to be put in place to ‚Äúsnap‚Äù this to lesson times
- there will be a 2x multiplier for australian volunteers and an 8x multiplier for american volunteers, based on their location
- it needs to be made *veryy* clear that volunteers need to click the start shift button, so it should be made clear in the onboarding email along with an email when the lesson is claimed and before the lesson itself
- volunteers should have a similar manage jobs view to the orphanages but only show their own jobs (orphanage should only show their own jobs too). Try to make emailing people easier by making the email very prominent, and time present too.
- rename the availability at the top to "Weekly Availability" and remove the numbers because that was a bit confusing (might have to fork the syncfusion calendar or add in an option to hide them).
