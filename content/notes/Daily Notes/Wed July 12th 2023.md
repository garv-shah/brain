Another day of app development.

In the morning I had a quick call with Guddi Masi and Advaith, which was really good and I got to show them the app so far. It's 1:18pm right now, and I've mostly spent the day refactoring code and trying to make it a bit neater.

At the Dusty rehearsal, Ms. Mellington also gave me the role of the Guardsman in Scene 18. He's kind of dim witted, and Zara's character Peg is explaining to him why Paul McCartney is coming to the party, but he doesn't really understand. Check your photos for what you gotta do!
