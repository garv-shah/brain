1. Uniform - scenario question: you are on the committee, and you have a job to encourage more students to wear their uniform with pride. How could you do this? 
- I think the school uniform looks wonderful, and with the new uniform being able to mix and match makes it much more convenient, which increases school pride
- I think allowing for variation was key and I can see the benefit around me
- Could possibly allow and maybe even encourage accessories that adhere to the school environment and vision to let students get creative. Could make a fashion show day where people get creative!
- Awards and embroideries are good, could move to make these cheaper as achievements
- Ensure that the dress code is fair and that everyone knows about it

2. What is your best leadership characteristic and why? 
   - Best trait is curiosity and love of learning
   - I always love learning new things, whether that be other people's approaches to problems or skills that benefit the team
   - Useful for being open to new ideas and being pushed out of my comfort zone

3. What’s a time and example that you have displayed service to someone or something? 

4. A time where you’ve had to make a decision that you knew you would affect others, but you also knew was right. 

5. A time that you have stood up for something that you believe in.
