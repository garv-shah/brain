<u>IMPROVE ACADEMICS</u>

### Research

Just write something, anything
- Look into Busy Beaver problem
- Collate the Algorithmics SAT into something usable
- Any other research ideas

Just write it all out, look at what other people have done and how you can do the same.

**Email 2nd rate universities, doesn't have to be good**. All you want is someone with a PhD looking over your work so it is reputable. Better to get it published than not published at all
