So, with the current square, we have 5 arithmetic sequences to solve.

- 1…25:

    This is the arithmetic sequence at the top, so $t_1=1$ and $t_5=25$

    The first term is 1 so $a=1$ 	

    $\therefore t_5=1+4d$ 

    $24=4d$

    $d=6$
    

    $t_n=1+6\left(n-1\right)$
    

    This means the sequence goes $1, 7, 13, 19, 25$

- 1…17:

    This is the arithmetic sequence at the left, so $t_1=1$ and $t_5=17$

    The first term is 1 so $a=1$ 	

    $\therefore t_5=1+4d$ 

    $16=4d$

    $d=4$

    
    $t_n=1+4\left(n-1\right)$

    
    This means the sequence goes $1, 5, 9, 13, 17$

- 17…81:

    This is the arithmetic sequence at the bottom, so $t_1=17$ and $t_5=81$

    The first term is 17 so $a=17$ 	

    $\therefore t_5=17+4d$ 

    $64=4d$

    $d=16$
    

    $t_n=17+16\left(n-1\right)$
    

    This means the sequence goes $17, 33, 49, 65, 81$

- 25…81:

    This is the arithmetic sequence at the right, so $t_1=25$ and $t_5=81$
    
    The first term is 25 so $a=25$ 
    
    $\therefore t_5=25+4d$ 
    
    $56=4d$
    
    $d=14$
    

    $t_n=25+14\left(n-1\right)$
    

    This means the sequence goes $25, 39, 53, 67, 81$

Now we have the following table:
| 1  | 7  | 13 | 19 | 25 |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 5  |    |    |    | 39 |
| 9  |    | X  |    | 53 |
| 13 |    |    |    | 67 |
| 17 | 33 | 49 | 65 | 81 |

We can either solve the vertical or the horizontal arithmetic sequence now, so arbitrarily we can go with the horizontal.


$t_1=13$ and $t_5=49$

The first term is 13 so $a=13$ 

$\therefore t_5=13+4d$ 

$36=4d$

$d=9$


$t_n=13+9\left(n-1\right)$


This means the sequence goes $13, 22, 31, 40, 49$


∴ $X$ is 31

## Question 2

> [!question] Question 2
> 
> For each positive integer $k$; let $a_k$ denote the increasing arithmetic sequence of integers whose first term is $1$ and whose common difference is $k$: 
>
> For example, $a_3$ is the sequence $1, 4, 7, ...$ 
>
> For how many values of $k$ does $a_k$ contain the term $2023$?
	
	Let the nth term of the sequence $a_k$ be $2023$:

	$a_n=1+k(n−1)$

	$∴2023=1+k(n−1)$

	$2022=k(n−1)$
	
    
	Now we have two terms, $k$ and $(n−1)$ whose product produces the number $2022$. By this logic, we should be able to list the factors of $2022$ to produce all the possible values of k.
	

    $$
	1×2022=2022
	2×1011=2022
	3×674=2022
	6×337=2022
	337×6=2022
	674×3=2022
	1011×2=2022
	2022×1=2022
	$$


	Therefore there are $8$ possible values of $k$ that contain the term $2023$.


3.  The terms of an arithmetic sequence add to 2023.
The first term of the sequence is increased by 1, the second term is increased by 2, the third term is increased by 3, and so on.

The terms of the new sequence add to 2176.

Find the middle term in the original sequence.

For the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5…

![image56](../../../resources/image56-2.png)

![image57](../../../resources/image57-2.png)

![image58](../../../resources/image58-2.png)

Since the sequence has a "middle" term, there must be an odd number of terms in the sequence and this middle term must be equivalent to the mean.

∴ The middle term is 119
