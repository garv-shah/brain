Below are 3 challenge problems.

Please choose ONE problem and attempt to solve it.

Then do your best to write a **CLEAR EXPLANATION** below of how to solve the problem. A classmate who reads your explanation should be able to follow and understand it. You can either type it, or write in your book and upload a photo below.

Even if you are not able to solve the problem, please explain
**YOUR THINKING PROCESS...**

- What did you try?
- Why didn't it work?
- What questions would you ask to help understand the problem?

# Question 1

So, with the current square, we have 5 arithmetic sequences to solve.

- 1…25:

    $$
    \textnormal{This is the arithmetic sequence at the top, so} t_1=1 \textnormal{and} t_5=25

    \textnormal{The first term is 1 so} a=1	

    \therefore t_5=1+4d

    24=4d

    d=6
    

    t_n=1+6\left(n-1\right)
    

    \textnormal{This means the sequence goes} 1, 7, 13, 19, 25
    $$

- 1…17:

    This is the arithmetic sequence at the left, so $t_1=1$ and $t_5=17$

    The first term is 1 so $a=1$ 	

    $\therefore t_5=1+4d$ 

    $16=4d$

    $d=4$

    
    $t_n=1+4\left(n-1\right)$

    
    This means the sequence goes $1, 5, 9, 13, 17$

- 17…81:

    This is the arithmetic sequence at the bottom, so $t_1=17$ and $t_5=81$

    The first term is 17 so $a=17$ 	

    $\therefore t_5=17+4d$ 

    $64=4d$

    $d=16$
    

    $t_n=17+16\left(n-1\right)$
    

    This means the sequence goes $17, 33, 49, 65, 81$

- 25…81:

    This is the arithmetic sequence at the right, so $t_1=25$ and $t_5=81$
    
    The first term is 25 so $a=25$ 
    
    $\therefore t_5=25+4d$ 
    
    $56=4d$
    
    $d=14$
    

    $t_n=25+14\left(n-1\right)$
    

    This means the sequence goes $25, 39, 53, 67, 81$

Now we have the following table:
| 1  | 7  | 13 | 19 | 25 |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 5  |    |    |    | 39 |
| 9  |    | X  |    | 53 |
| 13 |    |    |    | 67 |
| 17 | 33 | 49 | 65 | 81 |

We can either solve the vertical or the horizontal arithmetic sequence now, so arbitrarily we can go with the horizontal.


$t_1=13$ and $t_5=49$

The first term is 13 so $a=13$ 

$\therefore t_5=13+4d$ 

$36=4d$

$d=9$


$t_n=13+9\left(n-1\right)$


This means the sequence goes $13, 22, 31, 40, 49$


∴ $X$ is 31

3.  The terms of an arithmetic sequence add to 2023.
The first term of the sequence is increased by 1, the second term is increased by 2, the third term is increased by 3, and so on.

The terms of the new sequence add to 2176.

Find the middle term in the original sequence.

For the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5…

![image56](../../../resources/image56-2.png)

![image57](../../../resources/image57-2.png)

![image58](../../../resources/image58-2.png)

Since the sequence has a "middle" term, there must be an odd number of terms in the sequence and this middle term must be equivalent to the mean.

∴ The middle term is 119
