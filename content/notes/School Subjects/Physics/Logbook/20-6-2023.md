1. What does your graph indicate about the relationship between potential difference and current for the wire? State the relationship in mathematical form.
    The graph for the light bulb indicates that as current increases at a constant rate, potential difference increases at an increasing rate, following a parabolic relationship of $V=15120\times I + 88.638\times I - 0.0727$.
    $\therefore$ The light bulb is non-ohmic.
    
    Meanwhile, the fixed resistor indicates a direct proportionality, where an increase in current at a constant rate results in the potential difference increasing at a constant rate, following the linear relationship of $V=10.63\times I-0.042$.
    $\therefore$ The fixed resistor is ohmic.

2. Is the resistance constant for each component?
    No, the resistance is not constant for the light bulb, but was constant for the fixed resistor. This is demonstrated by calculating the resistance for each date points using the rule $R=\frac{V}{I}$.
    **Light Bulb:**
	- For $V=1.7$ and $I=0.009$, $R=118.89 \ohm$ 
	- For $V=3.4$ and $I=0.0127$, $R=267.72 \ohm$
	- Evidently these two values are not very similar, so not a constant resistance.
    **Fixed Resistor:**
	- For $V=2$ and $I=0.2$, $R=10 \ohm$ 
	- For $V=3.47$ and $I=0.33$, $R=10.52 \ohm$
	- Evidently these two values are relatively close, so there is a constant resistance.

3. The unit of resistance is OHM. Sow what 1 ohm is equal to in terms of volts and ampere.
