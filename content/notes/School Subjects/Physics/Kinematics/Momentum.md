Describes a characteristic of the motion of an object, or the "**mass in motion**"

$p$ - momentum (kg m s^-1)
$m$ - mass (kg)
$v$ - velocity (m s^-1)
$p$ = $mv$

## Change in Momentum

To change the momentum of an object ($\Delta p$), a net force needs to be applied over time.
A change in momentum would in most cases require a change in velocity, so $\Delta p = m \Delta v$ and $\therefore \Delta p = m(v-u)$.
This means that if $\sum\limits p = 0$ then $p_{i}=p_{f}$ meaning that if the sum of all momentum in a system is zero then the initial momentum will equal the final momentum.

Because a net force is required, $\Delta p = F_{net} \Delta t$ or $\Delta p = Ft$, which is a change in momentum over time. Changes in momentum don't happen instantaneously, there is always some period (no matter how small) over which this occurs.

## Impulse

An impulse is the net force experienced by an object over time. It results in a change in momentum.
$$
F_{net}=\frac{m \Delta v}{\Delta t}
$$
### Derivation

From Newton's Second Law, we know that $F_{net}=ma$. We also know that $a=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{v-u}{\Delta t}$. Subbing this into Newton's Second Law, we get $F_{net}=\frac{m(v-u)}{\Delta t}=\frac{m \Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$.
