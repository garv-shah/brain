projectile motion :: an object launched into space without motive power of its own is called a *projectile*

If we neglect air resistance, the only force acting on a projectile is its weight, which causes its path to deviate from a straight line.
The projectile has a *constant horizontal velocity* and a *vertical velocity* that *changes uniformly* under the influence of gravity.

Horizontal and vertical motion of projectiles are independent, meaning horizontal motion does not influence vertical motion. The link between the two is time only.

## Oblique Projectile Motion

Oblique projectile motion is when an object is launched at an angle.
