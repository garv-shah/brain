Inertia is the property of an object that represents the resistance to a change in motion of that object. Every object, whether initially at rest or moving with a certain velocity, possesses inertia.

The greater the mass, the greater the inertia and vice versa

## Conditions:
### First Half:
1. An object at rest where $\sum F = 0$ stays at rest
2. An object not at rest where $\sum F = 0$ continues in motion
### Second Half
1. An object will change its motion if $\sum\limits F \neq 0$
motion is a change in position: i.e. velocity
