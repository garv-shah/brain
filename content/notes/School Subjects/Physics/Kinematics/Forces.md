$F_{g}=$ gravitational force
$F_{r}=$ frictional force
Frictional forces can either slow something down or speed it up
$T=$ tensile force
For example, tug of war, the force in the rope when it's being pulled, or perhaps a hanging mass
$F_{N}=$ normal contact force (perpendicular to the surface), same magnitude as $F_{g}$ if no motion
