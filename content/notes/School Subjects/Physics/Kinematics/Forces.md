$F_{g}=$ gravitational force
$F_{r}=$ frictional force
Frictional forces can either slow something down or speed it up
$T=$ tensile force
For example, tug of war, the force in the rope when it's being pulled, or perhaps a hanging mass
$F_{N}=$ normal contact force (perpendicular to the surface), same magnitude as $F_{g}$ if no motion

Additionally, the equation for the vertical displacement of a horizontally launched projectile is:
$y=\frac{1}{2}gt^2$
The horizontal displacement is only influenced by the speed at which it moves horizontally, $v_{ix}$ so $x=v_{ix}\times t$.

Also
- $v_{x}=v\cos{\theta}$
- $v_{y}=v\sin{\theta}$
- $v^{2}=v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}$
