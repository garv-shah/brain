## Kinetic Energy
- $E_{k}$ or $KE$
- Energy due to movement of an object with mass
- $E_{k}=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$ (for speeds $<0.1 \space \textrm{speed of light}$)
- Usually (like always, but only if you remove it lol), mass is conserved
- $\therefore \Delta v \rightarrow \Delta E_{k}$
- $\Delta E_{k}=\frac{1}{2}m(v_{f}^{2}-v_{i}^2)$ or $\Delta E_{k}=\frac{1}{2}m(v^{2}-u^2)$

## Gravitational Potential Energy
- $E_{g}$ or $GPE$
- Energy due to position in a gravitational field of an object with mass
- $E_{g}=mgh$
## Springs
k (the spring constant) = $\frac{F}{x}$ or the gradient of a F vs x graph
- Note: As the displacement is a square relationship in $U_{s}=\frac{1}{2}k(\Delta x)^{2}$, when two springs are at equilibrium with the same fixed hanging mass, the spring with the lower spring constant ($k$) has a larger potential energy $\because$ the displacement outweighs the spring constant.
