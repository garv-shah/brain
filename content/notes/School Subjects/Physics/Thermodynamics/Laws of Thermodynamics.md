What is temperature the measure of? :: Temperature is the measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in substance. ^1677189354322

## Zeroth Law #card
The zeroth law states that if two thermodynamic systems are in thermal equilibrium with each other, and also separately in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then the three systems are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

## First Law #card
**Energy cannot be created or destroyed.** In other words, the total amount of energy in a system is conserved (constant), however, energy can be transformed from one from to another.

$U$ stands for the internal energy of a substance, which is the sum of **all** the energy in the substance, including:
- Potential energy in the bonds
- Rotational energy
- Vibrational energy
- Translational (kinetic) energy of the particles in the substance.

$Q$ stands for the thermal energy of a substance in Joules.

$W$ stands for the work done, and work is done when a force acts on an object and moves the object through a distance.
- Work by the system: "System pushes back on plunger and it goes up" (positive work) 
- Work on the system: "I push down on plunger to compress system" (negative work)

**Negative work increases the energy of a system**
This is because when work is done on a system, the system isn't really doing anything and it gets work done for it, ∴ it is negative

$$ΔU=Q - W$$

Work **BY** the system is ==positive== work.

Work **ON** the system is  ==negative== work.

### Specific Heat Capacity #card
The way the temperature increases when an object gains thermal energy depends on the material from which the object is made.
- The amount of thermal energy (heat energy) required to increase the temperature of an object by 1°C is termed the thermal capacity of the object (with the unit being $J °C^{-1}$, Joules per degree Celsius/Kelvin)
^1677189797344

To make comparisons easier we can compare the amount of thermal energy required to increase 1 kg of the material by $1°C$. This is termed the **specific heat capacity** of the material.

The symbol for specific heat capacity $c$ with the unit $J kg^{-1}°C^{-1}$ or $J kg^{-1}°K^{-1}$. 
This can also be written as $$c=\frac{J}{Kg \times K}$$
This can be rearranged to $c \times kg \times K = J$ and if we replace $J$ with $ΔQ$, $kg$ with $m$ for mass and K with $ΔT$, we get $$ΔQ=mcΔT$$

#### Example #card
How much heat energy is required to increase the temperate of 5kg of water by 80°C?
$ΔQ = mcΔT$
      $= 5 \times 4200 \times 80$
      $= 1680000$
      $= 1.68 \times 10^6 J$
