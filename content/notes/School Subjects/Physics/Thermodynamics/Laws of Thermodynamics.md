Temperature is the measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in substance.

## Zeroth Law
The zeroth law states that if two thermodynamic systems are in thermal equilibrium with each other, and also separately in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then the three systems are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
## First Law
**Energy cannot be created or destroyed.** In other words, the total amount of energy in a system is conserved (constant), however, energy can be transformed from one from to another.

$U$ stands for the internal energy of a substance, which is the sum of **all** the energy in the substance, including:
- Potential energy in the bonds
- Rotational energy
- Vibrational energy
- Translational (kinetic) energy of the particles in the substance.

$Q$ stands for the thermal energy of a substance in Joules.

$W$ stands for the work done, and work is done when a force acts on an object and moves the object through a distance.
- Work by the system: "System pushes back on plunger and it goes up" (positive work) 
- Work on the system: "I push down on plunger to compress system" (negative work)

**Negative work increases the energy of a system**
This is because when work is done on a system, the system isn't really doing anything and it gets work done for it, ∴ it is negative

$$ΔU=Q - W$$
