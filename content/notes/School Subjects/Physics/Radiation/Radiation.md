### Radioactivity
Any form of particles emitting radiation

- Natural: 88% of annual human dosage
	- Terrestrial radioactive sources within the Earth
	- Cosmic rays from outer space
		- Shielded by atmosphere -> higher doses at higher altitudes
- Artificial: 12% of annual human dosage
	- Mainly Medical sources (eg X-ray)
	- Nuclear power industry

## Timeline of Discovery
- 1895 - German scientist, Wilhelm Rontgen, discovers that X-rays are being emitted from cathode ray tubes
- 1896 - Frenchman, Henri Becquerel, investigates X-rays in a series of tests on potassium uranyl sulfate with photographic plates. He discovers that the uranium salt produces radiation (these are called Becquerel rays).
- Late 1890's - Marie Curie first uses the term 'Radioactivity' to describe the spontaneous and uncontrollable decay of an atomic nucleus, resulting in an emission of particles and rays (an atom that is emitting particles).

## X-rays
- X-rays are short wavelength electromagnetic waves formed from the sudden deceleration of an electric charge. (e.g. when electrons hit the end of a cathode ray rube)
- Wavelengths range from 0.001nm to 10nm.
- X-rays can penetrate flesh but not bone, and are thus used extensively for medical diagnosis.

## Types of Radiation
### Alpha (α) Decay
- Alpha decay occurs when an unstable parent nuclear ejects an alpha particle.
- α- particles are positively charged and consist of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, and is equivalent to a helium nucleus.
- The daughter nucleus becomes more stable. (the daughter is what is left behind)
### Beta (β) Decay
- β-particles are ejected from a parent nucleus when one of the neutrons spontaneously turns into a proton and an electron.
- The electron is emitted from the atom as a β-particle.
