> Light is incident on a piece of glass. The light travels from air (assume n = 1.00) in to the glass. In the air, the light beam makes an angle of 32.0° with the normal. In the glass it makes an angle of 21.0° with the normal.

1. List the angles of incidence and refraction in this situation
    Angle of Incidence: 32.0°, Angle of Refraction: 21.0°
2. What is the refractive index of the glass?
    Snell's Law tells us that 
    $n_{1}\sinθ_{1}=n_{2}\sinθ_{2}$
    ∴ Given the information from the question we can create the following equation where $n_{2}$ is the refractive index of the glass:
    $1\times \sin 32°=n_{2}\sin 21°$
    $n_{2}=\frac{\sin 32°}{\sin 21°}$
    ∴ The refractive index of glass is approx. 1.4787
3. The light beam re-emerges from the other side of the glass. What is the angle from the normal at which it emerges?
    32.0°

> Calculate the speed of light in seawater that has a refractive index of 1.38

$\frac{c}{v}= n$
$\frac{3\times10^{8}}{v}=1.38$
$v=\frac{3\times10^{8}}{1.38}$

> Light travels at a speed of $2.25 \times 10^{8} ms^{-1}$ in water and $2.29 \times 10^{8} ms^{-1}$ in ice. If water has a refractive index of 1.33, use this information to calculate the refractive index of ice.

$n_{2}=\frac{c}{v}$
$n_{2}=\frac{3\times10^{8}}{2.29\times10^{8}}$
$n_{2}=\frac{300}{229}$
$n_{2}\approx 1.31$

> Light travels from water (n = 1.33) into glass (n = 1.60). The incident angle is 44°. Calculate the angle of refraction

$n_{1}\sinθ_{1}=n_{2}\sinθ_{2}$
$1.33\sin 44°=1.60\sin θ_{2}$
$\sin^{-1}(\frac{1.33\sin 44°}{1.60})=θ_{2}$
$θ_{2}\approx35.27$

> For which of the following situations can total internal reflection occur?

| Incident medium  | Refracting medium |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| air (n = 1.00)   | glass (n = 1.55)  |
| glass (n = 1.55) | air (n = 1.00)    |
| glass (n = 1.55) | water (n = 1.33)  |
| glass (n = 1.55) | glass (n = 1.55)  |

All but the first are possible
