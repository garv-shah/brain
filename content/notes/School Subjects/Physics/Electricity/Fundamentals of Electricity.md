- Particles with "charge"
	- Subatomic $e^{-}, p^{+}$ 
- Coulomb - $6.24 \times 10^{18}$ $e^{-}$ or $p^{+}$ 
	- $\therefore$ charge on $1e^{-}$ or $p^{+}$
	- $\frac{1}{6.24 \times 10^{18}} = 1.603 \times 10^{-19}C$

$m = \textrm{mass in kg}$
$q = \textrm{charge in Coulomb} \space (C)$
$I = \textrm{current in Amps} \space \frac{C}{S}$ or Q/T
coulombs per second

Voltage $=\frac{J}{C}$ (joules per coulomb)
Voltage is Potential Difference, essentially the difference between two points
$P = IV$, Power = Current $\times$ Voltage
$V = IR$, Voltage = Current $\times$ Resistance
$R=\frac{V}{I}$ Resistance is in the unit $\ohm$ (ohm)

\*$\ohm = \frac{m^{2}\textrm{kg}}{s^{3}A^{2}}$ in S.I units, s = seconds, A = area

Resistance limits and controls $I$ in a circuit
- The electrical potential energy of the charge carriers is turned into thermal energy 
- A resister is a load, so any load can be modelled by a resistor

By conventional direction: red wire is first, by electron direction, black is first
