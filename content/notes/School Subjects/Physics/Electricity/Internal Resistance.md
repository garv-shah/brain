title: "Internal Resistance"

#physics #electricity 

Internal Resistance refers to the resistance of a component itself. For example, a battery at 20ยบ may have an internal resistance of $20 \ohm$ but at 30ยบ may have an internal resistance of $30\ohm$. This is modelled by both a battery and resistor in the diagram.

This links into the [[Applications of Electric Circuits]], since the resistance needs to be modelled well.
