Penelope is the main character of The Penelopiad, and presented as the wife of Odysseus in Homer's story, The [[Odyssey]]. She is portrayed as the faithful wife, someone who will stay true despite anything their husband does, a beacon for all other women to aspire to be, but never her own character or person.
