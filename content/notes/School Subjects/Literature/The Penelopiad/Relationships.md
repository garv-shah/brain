> Comment on the theme of relationships as reflected in chapter xii, Waiting

Relationships in Chapter 12, Waiting, are viewed almost as transactional with defined purposes in a very cold and non-compassionate manner. Atwood uses the chapter to express the idea that women are so often left behind and discarded in relationships, with Odysseus just leaving with not much more than a word, causing everything to blur into one monotonous cycle. All she did was wait for news in of Odysseus, further pushing the idea that her only worth is in relation to him.

The chapter also explores the idea that men have no consequences for their actions, and that anything they do will be glorified and portrayed as a wonderful tale, whereas the women's actions will never be credited to them, simply given to the man who did nothing. Atwood describes a Penelope who dreams of a day, "Odysseus returning and \[her] - with womanly modesty - revealing to him how well \[she] had done at what was usually considered a man's business. On his behalf, of course". It all had to be on his behalf, because within the text women have no voice at all or any individuality when removed for their male counterpart. Unlike Penelope, Odysseus could do anything, flirt with anyone, even Helen who "had bathed him and anointed him with her very own hands" and there were meant to be no consequences, because he can do whatever he pleases.
