title: "Calliope and the Painting"

#lit #flashwrite
Both the painting and Calliope both look very tired, like this has been going on for so long and they just want it to end. They are both also the subjects of painting, likely having to have sat as a model for so long, such a dull repetitive process that has completely drained them. They both are conventionally beautiful, dressed with riches and money, but there is a hollowness in their eyes, because none of it really means anything. Overall, she just seems tired and broken, because there is more to life than just the wealth and money that they are chasing, posing as an obedient wife character that will follow whatever the male lead says. The sense of dread permeates both the pieces, because they both would rather not be there.
