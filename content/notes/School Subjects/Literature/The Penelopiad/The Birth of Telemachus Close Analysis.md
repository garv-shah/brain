> Comment on how the passage illustrates the theme of power and powerlessness

Throughout the passage, Atwood uses the motif of water and ocean to represent the power of the world she has built. The ones who hold the power, Telemachus, Odysseus, the Gods all use water as a medium to enact their will. Telemachus' birth was not just a birth, it was a "nine-month voyage" to be celebrated, as was the great tale of Odysseus who travelled the many seas with great feats. At the same time, Atwood uses the metaphor of water to show how helpless those without power can be. The same power of the ocean just spat the maid out, "beached at the same time he was". They were simply spat out, discarded and sub-human.
