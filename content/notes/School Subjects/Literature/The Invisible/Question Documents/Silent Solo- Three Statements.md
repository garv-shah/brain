She very happy living in her own bubble, because even though she might see glimpses of the outside world not being as well off as them, she's very okay to continue living the way that she does.
2. Tor lives in a bubble and her brother El doesn't like this about her.
3. Tor lives in a bubble, so she cannot see further than her own life. She is content with the position she is in and is unaware of the situation around her.
