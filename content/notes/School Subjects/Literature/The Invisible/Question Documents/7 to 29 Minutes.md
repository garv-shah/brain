1)    What are the people protesting about outside Parliament?
People are protesting about the use of using digital tracking and identification to deter illegal movements in the city for people that are displaces by global flooding and climate change, taking away all the privacy of people to keep them under control.

2)    Who does Tor see on the television news? How long has it been since she has seen him?
Tor sees her brother on the news, and it's been 17 years since she's seen him.

3)    What consequences is Cal concerned about if Tor goes out to find him?
Cal is concerned that Tor will get caught on surveillance and be mistaken as a defacer, and that their status of ease won't mean anything if she goes outside to look for him.

4)    What does the man at Westminster mean when he tells Tor, “you’re talking to the invisible”? What is implied about the setting by this?
It is implied that he was never here, but also that she is talking to someone who was never registered and that cannot be seen by any digital systems. This "invisible" person will never be tracked, so it is the same as Tor never having talked to anyone.

5)    Why is Tor’s mum reluctant to use her Rose?
She doesn't like the use of technology everywhere, because she feels like she will wend up becoming too dependant on it and she wants to be able to do things herself.

6)    What does Rose find so difficult to interpret about the conversation between Tor and her mother?
The emotions and expressions that she was not programmed to register. She find it really hard to understand how they are feeling or what they are thinking about each other, because their feelings do not fall into the cookie cutter definitions of what people normally feel. She sats she can't understand the blank expression and the things that are left unsaid.

7)    Rose says, “And I wonder what it is like to stand and look at the sky. I can make a sky, but I cannot look at it. I can conjure a sea but I cannot experience its coldness.” What does she appear to be yearning for here?
She appears to be yearning for feeling and touch, similar to how humans feel it. She appears to be yearning for being human.

8)    What does Tor suspect has been hidden from the people of London?
Tor suspects that photos and information and the old plans of the city have been hidden from everyone.

9)    What is unusual about the library in Charing Cross Road? Why does Cal fear it will be dangerous?
Because it is not registered anywhere and is run by people off the books, otherwise known as defacers.

10) Why is Rose unable to see inside the “mind” of the library?
Because none of it is digital. She cannot index what is not digital so it is all isolated from her.

12) What does Tor discover about the Circle Line by consulting the A – Z?
That it is in fact not a circle, it is not just a circuit but there is a leg that travels outwards. This leg has been hidden and removed from all the maps everywhere.

14) What is outside the borders of London?
Ladbroke Grove, and the rest of the leg. London was most likely isolated as an island after some great floods that isolated it from the rest of the country, and people no longer travel inside and outside the place.

16) How might Tor be able to get there?
Apparently there is a "ghost train" that travels sometime at night and takes people out of the central area outside of London, This is how she plans to get there.

17) “This is a library. You can open a book and read something, close it, forget it, but it’s still there. It exists, even if we don’t think about it.” Discuss the significance of this statement.
This links back to the title of the show. It is all invisible, but the information is still there even if you forget it. Information is always there when it is in its hard copy, but when it becomes digital it can all go away, even when people do not think about it. There is a lot behind the eyes of what we don't actively think about, a lot that is hidden.
