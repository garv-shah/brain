1) What lie does Tor tell the police officer?
She tells the police officer that she hasn't met El at all.

2) How does the detective try to blackmail Tor into giving him information about her brother?
He says that if she doesn't tell him the truth, they will remove her mother's status of ease.

3) What new command does Tor give Rose if she is in danger? Why does she do this?
She tells Rose to delete all information about her and all memories, because she does not want to be tracked or found.

4) True or false: even if Rose deletes all memories of Tor, she will still remember the shapes and patterns that Tor has taught her.
True

5) What is Cal concerned about? What does he want Tor to do?
He is concerned that Tor is throwing away everything that she has earned and her whole life for her brother who she hasn't seen in so long. He wants Tor to just forget about it.

6) “It’s never going to be for old people, is it? It was always going to be a two-way mirror. We see what we want to see; they see everything.” Explain what Cal means by this.
He says that Tor knows what she is creating, and she is safe creating something that helps her company spy on people, that Rose is meant for surveillance not "helping old people". He means that we can make our truth whatever we want, and in return they can see everything.

7) What is it that Rose cannot process?
The unspoken. The information that is not said or expressed but is in between people. Moments that are shared through silence.

8) Who is Leith?
El's son.

9) Why did El leave?
To go and marry a woman that he loved who did not have status of ease.

10) “I can make patterns of the world, recognise, splice, relearn behaviour, but there is something between them which I cannot see. I cannot make sense of the invisible. The things they don’t say or do.” (Rose) Why does Rose find it impossible to make sense of the invisible?
Because she cannot sense it, there is no data for her to go off. She is not human, no matter how much they try, because she cannot see what they *do not* do, only what they do. We have something between us, the moments of silence and the shared understanding that Rose will never have.
