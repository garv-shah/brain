title: Eight Minute Questions

1. "She continually expands in ways of thinking." "I taught her to ask questions." (Tor on Rose). How does the playwright Linda Marshall Griffiths want the audience to understand Rose?
Possibly Griffiths is positioning the audience to treat Rose like a learning child, like a project that was created to understand as much as possible and have a curiosity not much unlike that of a human. As such we are positioned to have sympathy towards Rose and treat her as more than just a machine.

2. List the clues about setting in the first seven to eight minutes of the play. Make an inference from these clues. What does Linda Marshall Griffiths want the audience to understand about the world in which this play takes place?
I think one of the clues is how Wren talks about how he enjoys fear to Rose. This is slightly unnerving, as an AI trying to grapple with human emotions may not fully understand the implications of that statement, because a lot of the time even humans don't interpret that correctly. I think this could possibly foreshadow that something more sinister is to come with Rose.

2. What question does Tor ask Rose? What is Rose's response? What does Tor ask Rose to do regarding this?
hmmm
