#### Question 1

The time (in minutes) it takes Jerry to cycle to school is given by the random variable $T$ with the pdf:
$$
f(t)=
\begin{cases} 
  \frac{1}{24}(t-6) & 6\leq t\leq10 \\
  \frac{1}{48}(K-t) & 10\leq t\leq K \\
\end{cases}
$$
a) Find $K$. Hence state the minimum and maximum times it could take Jerry to cycle to school.
b) Sketch the pdf on the set of axes below.
c) Find the median time it takes Jerry to cycle to school.
d) Find the expected time it takes Jerry to cycle to school.
e) Find, correct to three decimal places, the probability that Jerry takes longer than 10 minutes at least twice in a 5-day school week.
