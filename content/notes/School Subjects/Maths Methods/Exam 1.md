Suppose that the queuing time, $T$ (in minutes), at a customer service desk has a probability given by
$$
f(t)=
\begin{cases} 
  \frac{1}{64}t(16-t^{2}) & 0\leq t\leq4 \\
  0 & \textrm{elsewhere} \\
\end{cases}
$$
What is the probability that a person has to queue for more than two minutes, given that they have already queued for one minute?
