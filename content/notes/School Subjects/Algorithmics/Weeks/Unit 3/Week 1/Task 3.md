a) You could fill up the 3 litre jug, pour it into the 5 litre jug, fill up the 3 litre jug again, pour as much as you can into the 5 litre jug until it is full, meaning you will have 1 litre remaining in the 3 litre jug, and finally empty the 5 litre jug. This leaves you with just 1 litre in the 3 litre jug. 

b) You could probably write it out in steps 

1. Fill up the 3 litre jug so it is full 
2. Pour this amount into the 5 litre jug 
3. Fill up the 3 litre jug so it is full 
4. Pour water from the 3 litre jug into the 5 litre jug until the 5 litre jug is full, leaving a litre in the 3 litre jug 
5. Empty the 5 litre jug 

c) Yes, I made a diagram and it seems to be the most efficient
