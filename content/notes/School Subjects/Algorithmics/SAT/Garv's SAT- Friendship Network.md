> How can a tourist best spend their day out?

> [!info]
> I've been finding it hard to plan trips with my friends, especially when everybody lives all over the city and we would all like to travel together. This SAT project aims to model the Victorian public transport network and its proximity to friends' houses, factoring in data about each individual to find the most efficient and effective traversals and pathways for us travelling to locations around Victoria.

I will start and end my day at my house, picking up all my friends along the way. The algorithm will find the quickest route to go to all my friends' houses, go to our desired location(s), and drop them all off before I go back to my own house. It will then return to me the traversal path, the time taken, and my cost for transport throughout the day.
