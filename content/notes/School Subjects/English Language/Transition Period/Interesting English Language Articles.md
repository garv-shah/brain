1. The Scots Language
	This is a really interesting article I found through [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP-PV9ryXM4) by xidnaf, and it talked about when a language actually becomes a different language. The line seems to be *really* blurry surprisingly.
	
	The video mentions that linguists actually split languages by mutual intelligibility, so if people can understand each other even though some words are different or dialects/accents are different, the language is the same.
	
	This still has its own problems though, because for example the Chinese "languages" are referred to as dialects even though they can't exactly understand each other, but they still use the same writing system, so you're in the weird position of they speak different languages, but they write in the same one ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
	
	Dialect Continuums are also a thing which is cool, overall there's just quite a big range. Australian people might struggle to understand British people, not a different language, but could still maybe understand a *few* loan words in Arabic or such, and the range varies such as English with German etc.
	
	It's also not symmetrical e.g. people from Denmark can understand people from Sweden a lot better than vice versa.
	
	All in all, what even is a different language is basically up to what we call it, and in the end it's basically all politics funnily enough.
	
	And now we get the Scots Language! It split from Old English similar to modern English, which was spoken about 1000 years ago in Britain. This is completely seperate to Scottish mind you, but is rather a remnant of what Old English was like.
	
	Here's a demonstration of the Scot's Language which can be found [here](https://youtu.be/cENbkHS3mnY) and helped demonstrate the concept of mutual intelligibility, which is quite common in other places but not so much for native English speakers

2. Why is the letter w so weird?
	Like isn't it so odd that it's like double u, but it's not even shaped like that, like where did that come from??
