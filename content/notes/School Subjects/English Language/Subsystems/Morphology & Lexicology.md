## The Parts of Speech
A part of speech is a class of words based on the word's function, the way it works in a sentence. They are sometime's referred to as word classes.
### Nouns
'Noun' is the name given to words that name things or concepts.
There are many different types, or sub classes of nouns, some you will be familiar with, other maybe not.
### Verbs
Verbs are words that describe what a subject is doing. They also describe relationships between one thing and another, allowing us to place an event, state, etc. in the past, present or future. 
### Adjective
A word that modifies or defines a noun, or a describing word. 
##### Degrees of Adjectives
- Positive Degree: plain old adjective, e.g. happy
- Comparative Degree: e.g. happier
- Superlative Degree: e.g. happiest
- Absolute: e.g. unique
### Adverbs
Adverbs are words that change, modify or qualify a verb, or another adjective/adverb. 
### Pronouns
Pronouns are words which we use in place of a noun, to avoid being repetitive.
The noun they replace is known as the antecedent. The antecedent doesn't always come before the pronoun that replaces it.

Saying "John did ....... He ......." is **anaphoric reference**, whereas if the pronoun was before it would be **cataphoric reference**. 
### Prepositions
As the name suggests, a preposition places, links or connects words and phrases to other words and phrases within a sentence. Prepositions usually come directly before a noun in a sentence and can also precede a gerund verb (non-finite form, -ing version where it's being used as a noun "shopping really annoys me").
### Conjunctions
Conjunctions connect words, phrases, clauses and sentences. They tell us the relationship between 'thoughts'.
### Interjection
An interjection is a word or expression that occurs as an utterance on its own and expresses a spontaneous feeling or reaction.
The category is quite heterogeneous, and includes such things such as exclamations, curses, greetings, response particles, and hesitation markers.
