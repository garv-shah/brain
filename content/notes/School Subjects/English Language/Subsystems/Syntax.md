Syntax refers to sentence <u>structure</u>, whereas the sentence types refers to semantics.
This means it studies the parts of a sentence, and how information s organised within speech or writing.

- Every sentence contains a subject and a predicate
- The subject refers to what or who is doing the action within the sentence. This is normally found at the beginning of an English sentence.
- The predicate tells us about the subject.  It contains the verb, direct and indirect object etc.
- If a group of words  does not contain both a subject and a predicate it is not a sentence – it is a phrase.

## Clauses #card 
Clauses express one idea, and they are made up of the following:
subject, verb, object, complement, adverbial

## Phrases #card 
A phrase is a group of two or more words which act as a part of speech. They generally do not contain either a subject or a finite verb. They also perform the function of a particular word class.
### Finite Verbs
In order for a verb to be finite is must contain a subject, tense and a number.  For example: 
Loving life. 
Subject:  unknown
Tense:  Present
Number: unknown
Therefore it is a phrase.
