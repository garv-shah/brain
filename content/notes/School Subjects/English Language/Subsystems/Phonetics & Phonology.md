## Phonetics
Phonetics is the study of human speech sounds, how they're produced, transmitted and received. Phonetic transcription focuses on the precise way in which a sound is produced by a particular speaker on a particular occasion, but is not related to any particular language.

- We refer to individual sounds as phones or sounds, never letters
- There are two kinds of transcriptions using the IPA; broad and narrow
- All broad (general or phonemic) transcriptions is done with phonetic slashes /si/
- •All narrow (phonetic) transcription is done within phonetic brackets:  \[si]

### Fields
#### Articulatory Phonetics
How sounds are produced
#### Acoustic Phonetics
Physical properties of sounds
#### Auditory Phonetics
How sounds are perceived

### Transcription
Transcription aims to create a system of one-to-one sound-symbol correspondence, which is not necessarily the case with spelling.

Examples of transcription:
- Next: /nɛkst/
- Chin: /tʃɪn/⁠ 
- Lamb: /læm/ 
- Kite: /kaɪt/
- Cat: /kæt/
- Meet: /miːt/

### The International Phonetic Alphabet
The IPA is an international alphabet that can transcribe any of the world's languages.
- In IPA transcription, one phone (IPA symbol) usually equals one sounds

### Allophones
Allophones are more specific interpretations of a phoneme, made for narrow transcriptions.

### Place + Manner
#### **Place** of Articulation
**Where** the sound is made

**How** the sound is made

## Phonology
Phonology is the study of the sound system of a specific language. The sounds of the English language for instance are very different to the sounds of Italian or Mandarin, and the sounds of Australian English differ from those of American English.
