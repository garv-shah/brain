Children go through 4 stages of linguistic development:
- Preverbal (0-11 months)
- Holophrastic (11-18 months)
- Telegraphic (1.5-2.5 years)
- Multi-word (2.5+ years)

According to the textbook, more accurately:
- Pre-verbal (0-5 months)
- Babbling (5-12 months)
- One-word (12-18 months)
- Two-word (18-24 months)
- Telegraphic (24-30 months)
- Post-telegraphic (30+ months)

## Preverbal Stage
In this stage children communicate via:
- Soundless communication
- Turn taking/Eye gaze
- Body language
- At about 5-7 months old: Talking sounds (babbling)

## Holophrastic Stage (one word utterances)
Around 12-18 months
At this stage:
- One word can mean a range of sentences in this stage, ie doggie could be "Here comes the dog", "I love the dog" or "The dog is over there"
- Children increase their understanding of intonation and gesture
- Usually, consonant vowels sounds
- Capable of around 50 words, but can understand a lot more
