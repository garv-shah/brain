## Development
Children can become bilingual or multilingual in two ways:
### Consecutive
Child learns one language, then another
### Simultaneous
Child learns both languages at once
#### Stages
Simultaneous bilinguals go through three stages in their development.
##### Stage 1
Lexicon consists of mixture of words (usually not translations of each other)
##### Stage 2
Mixing of languages in same utterances
##### Stage 3
Separation into two lexicons, although grasping syntactic and morphological complexity of languages takes greater time
