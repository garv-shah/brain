## Behaviourist - Skinner
Children imitate adults. Their correct utterances are reinforced when they get what they want or are praised.

B.F. Skinner is the main theorist associated with the language learning theory. He states that language learning involves "input, imitation, and habit formation through repetition". This conclusion was reached.

All children are born as a "blank slate", and all learning happens through a process called operant conditioning. A child can be trained to repeat certain actions if they get a favourable response (positive reinforcement) or a lack of any positive response that will discourage repetition in the future (negative enforcement).

Role of caregiver: models language for the child to copy and provides positive reinforcement for success.
Lexical development: copies lexemes as heard
Syntactic development: children learn key phrases and then substitute key words
"Monkey hear, monkey say!"
### Limitations
- Children rarely simply repeat what adults say
- Children often make 'virtuous errors' - logical but non-standard utterances, which suggest they are creatively working out grammatical rules, not copying
- Children appear to go through the same predictable stages of development whatever the input. This throws into question the importance of positive and negative reinforcement from adults.

## Innateness/Nativism - Chomsky
A child's brain contains special language-learning mechanisms at birth.

Argued that the human brain has a naturally programmed ability to learn language and an ability to work out language systems in terms of grammar and syntax.
The term *universal grammar* is also used to describe this global capacity to learn languages at similar rates and in similar ways.
The idea of virtuous errors helps support the idea of the LAD.

Nutshell: Language Acquisition Device (LAD) is programmed to acquire language, all children have inbuilt ability to learn language
Role of caregiver: do not activity shape or train children in their language
Lexical development: the brain knows the words go onto categories and fits them once exposed
Syntactic development: LAD processes the categories of words and how these categories interact within syntax to place words in sentences
"I was born to talk!"

### Limitations
It has been argued that a child is born not with a set of linguistic categories but with some sort of process mechanism - a set of procedures and inference rules.
The work was also purely theoretical, not based on linguistic data.
The theory also seems to downplay the part played by interaction between the children and their carers.

## Cognitive - Piaget
Language is just one aspect of a child's overall intellectual development.

This suggests that children would not develop until particular stages of cognitive development had been reached.
Outlines four cognitive stages: Sensorimotor (0 - 2) years, Pre-operational (2-6/7 years), Concrete operational (6/7-11/12 years) and Formal operational (11-16+ years).

For example, a child would not be able to use comparative adjectives (small, smaller, smallest, etc) unless they first understood the concept of size.
It's possible to link a child's language to their conception development in early stages, such as object permanence which enables the child to articulate abstract ideas and talk about non-deictical concepts.

## Interaction - Bruner
This theory emphasises the interaction between children and their caregivers.

Rejects the LAD and focuses on the importance of a child's interaction with caregivers as the key to language development.
Suggested the importance of a Language Acquisition Support System (LASS) which refers to the caregivers and other important participants within a child's life.
Suggested that the way in which carers question, encourage and support the child through scaffolding (like fill in the gaps, basically helping/structure) enables children to gradually develop their speech.
Concentrated more on the need for quality input from caregivers to facilitate learning rather than on imitation and positive/negative reinforcement. 

### Limitations
All children of all backgrounds and languages tend to progress through similar stages predictably, so this challenges the idea that children exposed to child-directed speech will tend to develop more quickly.
Some cultures (e.g. the Kaluli tribe in Papua New Guinea) dont appear to use child-directed speech at all to young children - yet youngsters' language seems to develop at the same rate as elsewhere.
