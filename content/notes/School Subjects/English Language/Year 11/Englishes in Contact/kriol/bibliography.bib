	abstract = {This chapter examines the place of creoles in the modern-day education milieu. It acknowledges the many ideological challenges and practical considerations for creoles in the educational space whilst bringing a multilingual education perspective to the fore. Using the concept of a contact language ecology, the chapter unpacks the language components that typically feature in multilingual education for creole speaking students. This approach reflects the linguistically heterogeneous contexts typically faced by education stakeholders in creole speaking speech communities that involve students' creole mother tongue as well as standard languages and often heritage languages too. On-the-ground case studies in different jurisdictions are included to illustrate a range of educational initiatives that have been implemented for creole speakers and the kinds of factors that have influenced these, including language policy and planning.},

	abstract = {"The Routledge Handbook of Pidgin and Creole Languages is a state-of-the-art volume on Pidgin and Creole studies. Providing unique coverage and equal coverage of nearly all parts of the world where such languages are found, as well as in situating each area within a rich socio-historical context, this book presents fresh and diverse interdisciplinary perspectives from leading voices in the field. Divided into five sections, its analysis covers: Areal perspectives on pidgin and creole languages; Ideology, history and theoretical constructs; Pidgin and Creoles and the evolution of human languages; Sociolinguistic perspectives on pidgin and creole languages; Creoles as socio-cultural forms; In all instances where two or more different languages come into contact, be that in a financial transaction, alongside a border, during long journeys, in war and in trade, the possibility arises for new words, sounds, and phrases to transfer from one language onto another. This requires an understanding of the dynamics of different forms of labour, such as slavery, and the effects of power on language learning. This book will show you how fundamentally human and natural these communication systems are, rich in expressive power and sophisticated in their complexity, on a par with any other language spoken out there. The Routledge Handbook of Pidgin and Creole Language features original contributions from an international range of renowned scholars as well as academics at the forefront of innovative research and is an essential reference for anyone with an interest in this area"--},

	abstract = {Relativism, roughly put, is the view that truth and falsity, right and wrong, standards of reasoning, and procedures of justification are products of differing conventions and frameworks of assessment and that their authority is confined to the context giving rise to them. More precisely, ``relativism'' covers views which maintain that---at a high level of abstraction---at least some class of things have the properties they have (e.g., beautiful, morally good, epistemically justified) not simpliciter, but only relative to a given framework of assessment (e.g., local cultural norms, individual standards), and correspondingly, that the truth of claims attributing these properties holds only once the relevant framework of assessment is specified or supplied. Relativists characteristically insist, furthermore, that if something is only relatively so, then there can be no framework-independent vantage point from which the matter of whether the thing in question is so can be established.},

@article{bundgaard-nielsen2015,
	abstract = {Despite being the largest Indigenous Australian language, Kriol---an English-lexified creole spoken across the northern part of Australia---is still largely unexamined from an instrumental or phonological point of view. This hampers efforts to predict crosslinguistic difficulties experienced by Kriol speakers in English-language settings and crucially in predicting the difficulties that Kriol-speaking children face in learning Standard Australian English. We report here on the vowel inventory of Kriol, which has previously been claimed to have between five and seven monophthongs and three or four diphthongs ([19],[20]). We show that its vowel system is in fact a triangular five-vowel system, with a duration contrast, and a number of diphthongs. This system thus reflects, in certain respects, typical inventories of the Indigenous substrate languages, except that, by radically increasing the number of available phonemes, Kriol has managed to keep the majority of vowel contrasts of English intact.},

@article{dickson2015,
	abstract = {Increasingly, the field of linguistics is highlighting and attending to global patterns of diminishing linguistic diversity but to a significant extent it remains unclear what the loss of a language actually entails in cultural terms. In the Roper River Region of the Northern Territory few Marra people speak their heritage language, shifting almost completely to becoming a Kriol-speaking population. This study considers the Marra language and its speakers and the Kriol spoken by young adults to explore loss and maintenance evidenced in the lexicons of the two languages and cultural and linguistic practices of speakers of both languages. A detailed timeline embeds the study in its social and cultural context (Chapter 2), populating it with stories of those whose lives intersect various stages in the shift. A survey of the lexicon of Kriol (Chapter 3) demonstrates the extent to which Marra lexical material and associated denotata have infiltrated the newer, supplanting language. This survey reveals a previously under-documented prevalence of Marra verbs in Kriol (Chapter 4), belying popular notions that substrate lexical material most commonly occurs in nominal classes. Person reference and the domain of kinship are considered (Chapter 5). A comparison of kin categories and kinterms used by Marra and Kriol speakers shows that Kriol speakers use fewer kinterms and have collapsed some distinctions found in Marra. Yet many categories and some lexical forms are maintained in Kriol, while the use of kinterms in person reference and other pragmatic uses, such as politeness strategies, is similar across both languages. Additionally, Kriol speakers have innovated upon their kinship system in some ways not attested in Marra or English. Finally, the domain of ethnobiology is considered, with specific attention paid to traditional medicine - a domain typically thought to clearly show the effects of shifts in language and lifestyle. A first pharmacopeia of Marra bush medicine is presented (Chapter 6), followed by a quantitative study of Kriol speakers' knowledge and use of bush medicine (Chapter 7). This reveals a shift in the salience of ethnobiological taxa in relation to the ceremonial lives of Kriol speakers and an overall reduced knowledge base. However, Kriol speakers are found to be maintaining core health beliefs pertaining to bush medicine, and display a greater degree of knowledge, usage and nomenclature than had been previously described. Given the large-scale social disruption and lifestyle changes that have occurred since Marra ceased being transmitted to children, it is impossible to reach definitive conclusions about the manifestations that the loss of the language has for the ontology of Kriol-speaking Marra people. This study describes numerous continuations of lexical use, pragmatics and cultural practices among Kriol speakers, alongside expected areas where Kriol speakers' cultural practices and language use does not reflect the knowledge of their Marra speaking forebears and the intricacies of their language. Given the examples of maintenance and innovation, I warn against simplistic negative generalisations about the effects of language loss on the culture of generations who live on the other side of language shift boundaries.},

Spoken by around 20,000 people it has also now been the subject of linguistic research for around half a century. This chapter offers a panoramic view of Kriol, beginning with summary discussions of its origins, status, and ethnolinguistic vitality. This is followed by commentary on where Kriol fits in relation to English, to other creole languages and to substrate languages. The discussion of structural aspects of Kriol pays attention to lexical and semantic aspects, discourse, pragmatics, and variation while still covering core features of phonology, morphology, and syntax. The chapter also serves to bring attention to an array of research that has been carried out on Kriol in the past decade.},

@article{munro2005,
	abstract = {Kriol, an English lexified creole language of northern Australia, is the primary language of the Roper River region in the Northern Territory. This thesis examines Roper Kriol for evidence of influence from the Indigenous substrate languages of that region. A method used only twice before in the field of pidgin and creole studies, the Transfer Constraints approach, is used to do this. In this way this thesis also aims to further test this theoretical construct. Chapter 2 provides the sociohistorical background to the emergence of Kriol in the Roper River region, which includes: demographic figures; description of contact in the pastoral industry; and a summary of language contact. This information leads to an identification of the timeframes for when the processes of transfer and levelling may have occurred. In each chapter to follow, the Roper River substrate languages are compared to find shared core features. Predictions are made based on the reinforcement principle of frequency as to the features that could be expected to have been retained during levelling of the stabilising pidgin and ultimately would be found in Kriol. A description of any corresponding Kriol feature follows. The availability constraints of perceptual salience and congruence are then examined in relation to English, in order to determine whether transfer to the preceding pidgin was constrained or not. The discussion also takes into consideration pidgins in the environment that preceded the creole, alongside other linguistic processes. Chapter 3 starts by examining the morphology of the verb complex and similarly chapter 4 examines the morphology of the nominal complex. Chapter 5 examines semantic category transfer in relation to the pronominal, TMA and case marking systems. Finally, chapter 6 provides an analysis of the nature of nominal modification for evidence of transfer of demonstrative, adjective, possession marking and number marking strategies.},

	abstract = {In this thesis I describe aspects of referring expressions and referential practice in an English-lexified creole language spoken in the Ngukurr Aboriginal community, in the Northern Territory of Australia. Kriol has substrate influences from seven traditional Aboriginal languages. Dialects of Kriol are spoken in Aboriginal communities across the Top End of Australia; with estimates suggesting more than 20,000 people speak it as a first language. The language has a low status and in many contexts, such as health, medical and legal contexts, it frequently goes unrecognised as a legitimate language requiring interpreters. There is no comprehensive grammar of Kriol and as yet, there have been few in-depth studies into its structure and use. I investigate referential expressions in Kriol from various perspectives, using tools from a range of theoretical frameworks and research traditions, including descriptive linguistics, discourse analysis, information structure, and ethnopragmatics. The thesis provides an integrated description of how referential expressions are structured and how they are used in spontaneous talk to meet communicative needs. A further goal of this thesis is to demonstrate that there is significant continuity of referring strategies from Kriol's Aboriginal substrate languages. The data used in this study consists of a corpus of spontaneous discourse between two or more speakers, elicited material, and consultation with Elders on cultural issues relevant to language use. ... Each chapter contributes original description of the Kriol language. By combining a number of theoretical perspectives, the thesis offers an integrated description of the structure and function of referring expressions.},

	abstract = {Abstract             This article describes the semantic values of reduplication in Barunga Kriol~-- an English-based creole of northern Australia~--, with a focus on its expressive functions. Barunga Kriol reduplication has two types of functions. Its most frequent meaning is aspectual atelicity. In addition, it has a number of expressive meanings and connotations: hypocoristic usages; descriptions of children's games and imitations; and a softening role in imperatives and reprimands. Contrary to the aspectual value of reduplication which is iconically motivated, expressive values are motivated by the pragmatic association of reduplication with children.             Expressive uses of reduplication in Borunge are rarer and less regular than the grammaticalized aspectual uses, which are very frequent. Aspectual reduplication is optional most of the time, so that explaining its actual distribution in discourse is a complicated matter. This article shows that this distribution can often be explained in the view of the expressive values of reduplication (some of them also conveyed by affixal evaluative morphology in the Australian languages that have been replaced by this creole). Thus, taking into account the expressive dimension of reduplication contributes significantly to the linguistic analysis of the grammaticalized aspectual function of reduplication.},
