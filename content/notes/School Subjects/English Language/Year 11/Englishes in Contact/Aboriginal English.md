Aboriginal English is a dialect of Australian English spoken by Indigenous Aboriginal communities. 
- Aboriginal English is not to be confused with Kriol, a seperate language to English
## Research Task
### Phonetics And Phonology
Basilect varieties of AAE that are heavily influenced by the indigenous substrate tend to have a very restricted set of vowels compared to SAE.

In general, no distinction between tense and lax vowels, so pairs such as 'sleep' and 'slip', 'shared' and 'shed', 'cart' and cut would all be pronounced the same.
Another pair that falls together is /e/ and /Ã¦/ with 'bed' and 'bad' both being pronounced more like the former.
