## English Across the World
Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English
![Three Circles Model.png](Three Circles Model.png)

The 'Inner Circle' shows examples of countries where English is the 'primary' language, namely as an official language of the country and spoken by the majority.

The 'Outer Circle' shows examples of countries where English is widely spoken often as a second language, and is an 'official language'.

The 'Expanding Circle' shows the countries where English is widely spoken as a foreign language, but not an official language or necessarily spoken by the majority. 

Adaptation is chiefly in the vocabulary or lexicon, because people need new words to describe foreign concepts.

> "Everywhere, in every country in the world, there is a new variety of English that develops" - David Crystal

> Loan words, borrowed words

## Varieties of the same Language
The following are used more for when there is a mix of two languages, i.e. creoles and pidgins. They are similar to broad, general and cultivated Australian English in terms of prestige.

Basilect :: a less prestigious dialect or variety of a particular language.

Mesolect :: a variety of speech that is midway between the acrolect and the basilect.

Acrolect :: the most prestigious dialect or variety of a particular language. The acrolect is the closest to the 'standard' of a language.

## Australian Varieties

Each different variety varies depending on the heritage background of the speakers

There is also a variety of Australian English called 'Strine' - the word 'Strine' itself represents a poor pronunciation of the word 'Australian'.
