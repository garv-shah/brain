title: Prestige and Language
---

Received Pronunciation:: the accent needed to be received in court, very much like the queen's English

Overt prestige:: language that is openly prestigious, such as the English accent or the cultivated Australian accent

Covert prestige:: language because it is "cool", such as the language of hip hop and how it is trendy. People might tend to go "downwards" with their language such as trying to be cool and using AAVE language from pop-culture.
