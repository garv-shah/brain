## Definition 1
### Source: [Language Meaning & Concept | What is Language? - Video & Lesson Transcript | Study.com](https://study.com/learn/lesson/language-meaning-concept.html)
### Definition:
Essentially, language is a term for any complex communication system used by humans that consists of words and phrases that, when combined, can create infinite variable utterances. How humans initially developed language is not wholly clear and is something that linguists are still researching. Most humans learn at least one language in early childhood. If a person lacks exposure to language as a young child, they will never be able to fluently learn a language as an adult because of how human brain development works.

## Definition 3
### Source: [what is language? : linguistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/bw37zc/what_is_language/)
### Definition:
A language is defined as a being an open system of communication. In other words, new symbols can be freely added to the system. For example, if I say that I define "vlirsnik" to mean "the feeling of learning something new" I can add it to this system of communication we are using right now and you will be able to understand it. Therefore, this is a language.

## What is common to your three definitions?
All three of the definitions mention that languages are a communication system, that try to express thoughts, ideas and feelings. They also mention that they have a common set of conventions that allow for a practically infinite set of meanings to be added.

## In your own words explain the word "language"
A language is a set of communication standards that aim to convey meaning in the form of ideas, concepts, thoughts and feelings. This is done in a way that ideas can be added to these said conventions to be able to convey new concepts that were previously not expressible, therefore being modular in its usage.
