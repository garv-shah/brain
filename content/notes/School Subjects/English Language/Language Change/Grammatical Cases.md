## Nominative
Denotes that the specific noun or pronoun is the subject of the sentence. For example, in "Mark eats cake," Mark is in the nominative case.

## Genitive
A noun case which is used mainly to show possession, such as 's in English.

## Accusative Case
The case used for a noun when it is the direct object of a verb, or the object of some prepositions. For example, in "The dog ate our turkey," our turkey would be the direct object and in the accusative case.

## Dative Case
A grammatical case used in some languages to indicate the recipient or beneficiary of an action. For example, in "we gave a bone to our dog," our dog is the recipient and therefore in the dative case.
