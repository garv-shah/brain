## Einar Haugen's Process of Standardisation
Huagen describes the process of standardisation as involving four aspects of development:
### Selection of a Norm
Term used to refer to the choice of a language variety to fulfil certain functions in a given society.
This can be somewhat controversial, as it requires choosing which varieties and forms the standard will be based on (subjective). In history this was often the prestigious variety, such as the one spoken by the nobility.
In the past, because only the nobility were predominately literate, they had a monopoly and the choice of the standard variety was not contested. Nowadays the choice is more nuanced.

### Codification of Form
This is where the selected standard is cemented, for example with the compilation of dictionaries and grammars. This process is what ultimately establishes what is correct and what isn't.
It reflects spoken language, but does not always involve pronunciation, just writing down "what is correct".

Codification does not make the standard, many varieties have dictionaries without having a standard, Scots being one example, and the Urban Dictionary is a very good example of codification of non-standard forms. 

"Codification is the spear of the prescriptivist, meaning that codification is used to argue the right way to use the language."

### Elaboration of Function (& modernisation)
Refers to the stylistic and syntactic development of a codified language to meet the communicative demands of modern life and technological advances.  

### Acceptance by the Community
