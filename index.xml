    <guid>https:/garv-shah.github.io/brain/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/Year-11/Englishes-in-Contact/Australian-Kriol</guid>
    <description> Kriol is an English-lexified creole language that originated in Northern Australia circa 1908, developed by the Indigenous Australian minority. With over 20,000 active language users, at least 10,000 of whom speak it as their primary language [@harris1986], the creole is now the most widely spoken language by Indigenous Australians after English [@dickson2023], namely throughout a wide band extending from western Queensland to the Kimberleys of Western Australia,1 as shown in [@Fig:figure0].</description>
