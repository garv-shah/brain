    <description> Uniform - scenario question: you are on the committee, and you have a job to encourage more students to wear their uniform with pride. How could you do this? I think the school uniform looks wonderful, and with the new uniform being able to mix and match makes it much more convenient, which increases school pride I think allowing for variation was key and I can see the benefit around me Could possibly allow and maybe even encourage accessories that adhere to the school environment and vision to let students get creative.</description>
