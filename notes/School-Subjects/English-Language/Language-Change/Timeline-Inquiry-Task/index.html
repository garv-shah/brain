This common feature of many languages surprisingly close to English leads to an obvious question: why did English lose its grammatical gender and how did such a large syntactic change occur over such a short time, leaving nothing but the smallest remnants in Modern English?</p><p>Some may find it surprising that Old English had a very intricate system of inflections for each of its 5 grammatical cases. Since then, there has been a significant inflection reduction, namely during the Middle English period where the -a, -u and -e suffixes all merged into the ending -e. Similarly, of the extensive case system, only 3 cases remaining in most modern usage and that too with much simplified inflections. Of these cases, the nominative case is particularly interesting as it houses most of our previous grammatical gender, one that many of the modern Germanic languages share with three categories: masculine, feminine and neuter. Nouns were assigned to one of these gender classes in &ldquo;classical&rdquo; West Saxon, where grammatical gender was well manifested, but over time there was a systematic process of syntactic and morphological change due to the decay of inflectional ending in English during the Middle English period. As English expanded further through the British Isles, contact with the languages from the north of England resulted in an overall decline of grammar, where consistency was simply not as important as it used to be due to the vast span of the language.</p><p>Within the nominative case, Old english had a vast system of inflectional morphemes that grouped nominal lexical items into their gender categories which always resolved to the gender of the person they were referring to. As we can see below, many lexemes in Old English had inflectional morphemes that denoted gender:</p><ul><li>bæcere/bæcestra &ldquo;baker&rdquo;</li><li>beþæcend/beþæcestre &ldquo;deceiver&rdquo;</li><li>cempa/cempestre &ldquo;warrior&rdquo;</li><li>lufiend/lufestre &ldquo;lover&rdquo;</li><li>tæppere/tæppestre &ldquo;tavern keeper&rdquo;
From the above list, there is a clear pattern that the suffix &ldquo;-estre&rdquo; marks the feminine gender case for nominal lexemes, but equally if not more common would be the irregular nouns with a range of essentially unrelated suffixes:</li><li>fyrenhycga/fyrenhycge &ldquo;adulterer/ess&rdquo;</li><li>horig/hora &ldquo;fornicator&rdquo;</li><li>nefa/nefene &ldquo;nephew/niece&rdquo;</li><li>þeow/þeowe &ldquo;slave&rdquo;</li><li>neahgebur/neahgebyrild &ldquo;neighbour&rdquo;
Even more confusingly, many unambiguously female nouns are assigned to the masculine gender with the suffix &ldquo;-man/mon&rdquo;</li><li>fæmenhadesmon &ldquo;virgin&rdquo;</li><li>hiredwifmon &ldquo;female member of a household&rdquo;</li><li>mægdenman &ldquo;virgin&rdquo;</li><li>mægþman &ldquo;virgin&rdquo;</li><li>wifmann &ldquo;women&rdquo;
Evidently, the examples above illustrate that the grammatical gender of a predicate in Old English did not always align with the natural gender of its subject, which would have been rather complicated namely for non-native speakers to pick up.</li></ul><p>This precisely demonstrated why grammatical gender had such a large downfall moving into the Middle English period: it was inconvenient and too complicated for newcomers to learn. For the same reasons Middle English saw an overall decline of inflections and accents, grammatical gender became an oversight as the language expanded and most suffixes began defaulting to their neuter form. As expansion and contact with new tribes often does, the &ldquo;new English&rdquo; that came about from the settlement of North England filtered out the complex elements of respective language, gradually washing away the remnants of an extensive grammatical gender system with it too.</p><a href=#caxton--the-printing-press><h2 id=caxton--the-printing-press><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Caxton & The Printing Press</h2></a><p>One of the most influential inventions in the history of the English language would be the printing press, brought to England by one William Caxton in 1476. The machine was revolutionary, making books orders of magnitude cheaper to produce and buy, and therefore caused the levels of literacy in the common English people to climb much higher than before. As the printing press was fixed in its codification, it also marked the beginning of a greater standardisation of syntax across the language.</p><p>Caxton started off as a successful merchant, serving as the governor of the &lsquo;English Nation of Merchant Adventurers&rsquo; for the better part of a decade. This not only allowed him to build a strong standing in the merchant community, but also act as a diplomat for the King at the time, through the process of which he gained a significant wealth.</p><p>In the early 1470s, his interests turned to literature and he started the work of translating books from French to English. Through these ventures, Caxton spent some time in Cologne, Germany learning of the printing presses they had started developing. Although printing with movable type had been invented many centuries earlier in China, the technology was not well developed in Europe until the mid-15th century, meaning that the printing press was quite new at the time. As he worked on his own eventual translation of <em>&lsquo;Recueil des histoires de Troye&rsquo;</em> (which later become the first book in history to be printed in English), he later recounted that how his &ldquo;pen became worn, his hand weary, his eye dimmed&rdquo; with the laborious task of copying the book. Simply, he found the work such a bore that he &ldquo;practiced and learnt&rdquo; at a great personal cost how to print it instead. The next year, toward the end of 1476, Caxton returned to England and established the now famous press at Westminster.</p><p>At the time, most continental printers made their books in Latin, the international language of the time, so that they could sell them to a wider market. Caxton chose to ride against this wave, and though they were still a luxury aimed at fairly wealthy people, over the coming decades the price of books fell heavily as he streamlined the process and reshaped the way in which people acquired books for information and entertainment.</p><p>Caxton was also responsible for the spread of the variety of English which was to become the standard throughout England. The need for a standard was becoming increasingly evident; as more books were produced, there was a need for a standard syntax to be agreed upon. Caxton adopted a certain variety of Middle English (the so called &lsquo;King&rsquo;s English&rsquo;) that was commonly used in London at the time, and spread this variety throughout England by his trade.</p><p>Though it cannot be asserted if this was a conscious choice or not, he most certainly put quite some thought and effort into the selection of syntax and lexemes to suite his preferences, as accounted in his &rsquo;egges&rsquo; story. Therewith other dialects of English were marginalised and many died out, but Caxton&rsquo;s work set out the groundwork for what we know today as the world&rsquo;s language. This work, so instrumental to the language we speak today, marked the start of a transition to modern English, but it was not until the first dictionaries were published that this standardisation would be further improved and blossom to maturity.</p><a href=#the-rise-of-the-internet---a-new-era-for-the-english-language><h2 id=the-rise-of-the-internet---a-new-era-for-the-english-language><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Rise of the Internet - A New Era for the English Language</h2></a></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Garv Shah using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/garvshah/>LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/garv-shah>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
