The aim is to place them in a row such that no-one is in danger: no hunter is next to a wolf, no wolf is next to a goat, no goat is next to a cabbage. Also no two counters may be placed next to each other. How many ways are there to solve the puzzle?\n\nFirst you can write down the rules in the opposite way. The question defines what can't be next to what, so we can say what can be next to what.  \n  \nG can be next to H  \nH can be next to C \u0026 G  \nW can be next to C  \nC can be next to H \u0026 W  \n  \nThis can be visualised by turning each into its own node, and making arrows to what it can be next to:  \nW \u003c--\u003e C \u003c--\u003e H \u003c--\u003e G  \n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n1[Wolf] \u003c--\u003e Cabbage \u003c--\u003e Hunter \u003c--\u003e Goat\n```\n  \nEvidently from this we can see that for all n, the sequence must start at W or G, because if it does not we would not be able to have an equal amount of all counters. For example, for n = 1, we can do WCHG or GHCW. For n = 2 we can do, WCWCHGHG or GHGHCWCW, and so on, given our restriction of all counters being equal in number.  \n  \n‚à¥ We can conclude that for all n, there are two solutions, starting with either W or G  \n  \n(this ended up being quite a similar answer to Blake, great minds must think alike haha)","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T08:56:34.800087175Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Algorithmics/Weeks/Week-1/Task-3":{"title":"","content":"a) You could fill up the 3 litre jug, pour it into the 5 litre jug, fill up the 3 litre jug again, pour as much as you can into the 5 litre jug until it is full, meaning you will have 1 litre remaining in the 3 litre jug, and finally empty the 5 litre jug.

They are sometime's referred to as word classes.\n### Nouns\n'Noun' is the name given to words that name things or concepts.\nThere are many different types, or sub classes of nouns, some you will be familiar with, other maybe not.\n### Verbs\nVerbs are words that describe what a subject is doing. They also describe relationships between one thing and another, allowing us to place an event, state, etc. in the past, present or future. \n### Adjective\nA word that modifies or defines a noun, or a describing word. \n##### Degrees of Adjectives\n- Positive Degree: plain old adjective, e.g. happy\n- Comparative Degree: e.g. happier\n- Superlative Degree: e.g. happiest\n- Absolute: e.g. unique\n### Adverbs\nAdverbs are words that change, modify or qualify a verb, or another adjective/adverb. \n### Pronouns\nPronouns are words which we use in place of a noun, to avoid being repetitive.\nThe noun they replace is known as the antecedent. The antecedent doesn't always come before the pronoun that replaces it.\n\nSaying \"John did ....... He .......\" is **anaphoric reference**, whereas if the pronoun was before it would be **cataphoric reference**. \n### Prepositions\nAs the name suggests, a preposition places, links or connects words and phrases to other words and phrases within a sentence. Prepositions usually come directly before a noun in a sentence and can also precede a gerund verb (non-finite form, -ing version where it's being used as a noun \"shopping really annoys me\").\n### Conjunctions\nConjunctions connect words, phrases, clauses and sentences. They tell us the relationship between 'thoughts'.\n### Interjection\nAn interjection is a word or expression that occurs as an utterance on its own and expresses a spontaneous feeling or reaction.\nThe category is quite heterogeneous, and includes such things such as exclamations, curses, greetings, response particles, and hesitation markers.","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T08:56:34.808087311Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/Subsystems/Phonetics-Phonology":{"title":"Phonetics \u0026 Phonology","content":"#englang #subsystem\n\n## Phonetics\nPhonetics is the study of human speech sounds, how they're produced, transmitted and received. Phonetic transcription focuses on the precise way in which a sound is produced by a particular speaker on a particular occasion, but is not related to any particular language.\n\n- We refer to individual sounds as phones or sounds, never letters\n- There are two kinds of transcriptions using the IPA; broad and narrow\n- All broad (general or phonemic) transcriptions is done with phonetic slashes /si/\n- ‚Ä¢All narrow (phonetic) transcription is done within phonetic brackets:¬† \\[si]\n\n### Fields\n#### Articulatory Phonetics\nHow sounds are produced\n#### Acoustic Phonetics\nPhysical properties of sounds\n#### Auditory Phonetics\nHow sounds are perceived\n\n### Transcription\nTranscription aims to create a system of one-to-one sound-symbol correspondence, which is not necessarily the case with spelling.\n\nExamples of transcription:\n- Next: /n…õkst/\n- Chin: /t É…™n/‚Å† \n- Lamb: /l√¶m/ \n- Kite: /ka…™t/\n- Cat: /k√¶t/\n- Meet: /miÀêt/\n\nA rough-coated, dough-faced, thoughtful ploughman strode through the streets of Scarborough.¬† After falling into a slough, coughed and hiccoughed.\n\n/…ô …πuf-k…ô äted, d…ô ä-fe…™sd, Œ∏…îÀêtf äl pla äm…òn str…µ äd Œ∏ruÀê √∞…ô striÀêts …íf sk…ëÀêbr…ô. …ëÀêft…ô f…îÀêl…™≈ã …™ntuÀê …ô sla ä, k…ëft and h…™k åpt/\n\n### The International Phonetic Alphabet\nThe IPA is an international alphabet that can transcribe any of the world's languages.\n- In IPA transcription, one phone (IPA symbol) usually equals one sounds\n\n### Allophones\nAllophones are more specific interpretations of a phoneme, made for narrow transcriptions. \n![[notes/School Subjects/English Language/Subsystems/Diagrams/Allophone Diagram.png]]\n\n### Place + Manner\n#### **Place** of Articulation\n**Where** the sound is made\n![[notes/School Subjects/English Language/Subsystems/Diagrams/Human Mouth Diagram.png]]\n##### Consonants\n![[notes/School Subjects/English Language/Subsystems/Diagrams/Consonant IPA Table.png]]\nThe top is the place and the and the left is the manner\n##### Vowels\n![[notes/School Subjects/English Language/Subsystems/Diagrams/Vowel IPA Table.png]]\n#### **Manner** of Articulation\n**How** the sound is made\n\n## Phonology\nPhonology is the study of the sound system of a specific language. The sounds of the English language for instance are very different to the sounds of Italian or Mandarin, and the sounds of Australian English differ from those of American English.\n- There are 44 sounds in Australian English (44 phonemes)\n- Each language has different sounds and stresses particular phonemes, and can completely change the meaning of the word (*pro*ject vs pro*ject*)\n\n### Connected Speech\nThere are no actual gaps in between words in speech generally, only written. \n#### Ellision (sounds are lost)\nThe omission (deletion) of a sound in connected speech - this sound may be a vowel, a consonant or even a whole syllable. For instance 'cos instead of pronouncing because. We often **elide** sounds in rapid, everyday speech purely for ease of pronunciation. Another example would be 'want to' vs wanna\n#### Vowel Reducation\nSimilar to elision but, instead of disappearing completely, vowels in unstressed positions are reduced to schwa /…ô/. So the word 'to' /tu/ might be reduced to /t…ô/\n#### Assimilation (sound change)\nWhen a sound changes to become more like a neighbouring sound. Assimilation may be *progressive* where the sound is affected by a preceding sounds, or *regressive* (also known as *anticipatory assimilation*), where the following sound is affected by a following sound. \n##### Examples\nProgressive:\n- talked becomes /t…îÀêkt/\n- pens become /penz/\nRegressive:\n- light blue /laip bluÀê/\n- green boat becomes /griÀêm b…ô ät/\n\n#### Insertion (sounds are added)\nThere are two examples of sounds being added, generally deliberately. The first is insertion, the other is epenthesis. **Insertion doesn't add a pull syllable, whereas epenthesis does**\n- a voiceless stop insertion where, between a nsal consonant and a voiceless fricative, a voiceless stop with the same place of articulation as the nasal consonant is inserted.\n\t- e.g. In English, many add a /p/ to hamster and say \"hampster\"/\n- after a nasal consonant, a voiceless stop may be 'added\n\t- e.g. In English, many add a /k/ to something which becomes /s åmŒ∏…™≈ãk/\n##### Epenthesis\nEpenthesis is the insertion of an extra sound into a word.\n- Involves the addition of sounds (syllables) where they don't strictly belong. For instance, it's common for people to insert a vowel in 'souvlaki' so that it sounds like 'souv-e-laki'. And humbling sometimes becomes humb-e-ling.\n##### Intrusion\nThis is where sounds are added between words but is not deliberate, but may be put together as insertion. \n\nWhen two vowel sounds meet, we tend to insert an extra sound which resembles wither a /j/, /w/ or /r/, to mark the transition sound between the two vowels, a device referred to as intrusion.\n- Consonants can also be added, for instance Australians often add r in law and order so that it sounds more like \"lor an order\".\n#### Metathesis\nMetathesis sounds complicated but it's a very common aspect of the English language. It is the transposition within a word of its sounds. The word \"metathesis\" comes from the Greek word meaning to transpose. It's also known as a permutation.\n- Ask becomes /arks/\n- Nuclear becomes /nuc…ôl…ôer/\n### Prosodic Features\nAffect **how** we say something\n- Volume is the modulation of volume in your voice, which is used to convey emotions\n- Tempo is the speed and which we speak, reasons for speaking faster or slower\n- Intonation is the pattern of pitch changes in speech, it is the variation of spoken pitch used in language. It can be used to\n\t- Indicate the different attitudes and emotions of the speaker\n\t- Signal the difference between statements, questions.\n- Stress is the degree of strength used to pronounce a syllable\n\nNon-verbal features do not affect the features of speech, while paralinguistic features (cough, laugh, breath, aka vocal effects) do impact my speech, meaning you can still hear them. \n\n### Phonological Patterning\n- Alliteration: seven slippery snakes\n- Assonance: he claps his hands and puts them in the sand\n- Consonance: Mike likes his new bike\n- Onomatopoeia: boom, crash, brrrrrr\n- Rhythm: I'm going down like a bottle of whiskey\n- Rhyme: The cat and the hat, sat on a mat","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T08:56:34.808087311Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/Transition-Period/Freedom-of-Speech-Essay":{"title":"Freedom of Speech Essay","content":"\n#englang #essay\nFreedom of speech: it is an integral part of our society's concept of freedom and liberty, and a right that many people do not have the privilege to exercise. Nonetheless, our nations are built on a notion of democracy that is flawed without this freedom, the ability to be able to articulate opinions and thoughts without the fear of being censored or face legal consequences. Time and time again, this right has been used to defend hate speech, and though freedom of speech definitely gives people the right to use hate speech, as it always has done, this does not mean people are exempt from any form of retaliation.\n\nVery frequently when people say that their freedom of speech is being violated, what they actually mean is that they are upset that people do not agree with them. In no way has anyone physically stopped them from saying ludicrous or hateful things, they have just faced retaliation for the harmful messages they are spreading. Such petty individuals seemingly miss the point of the concept: they are allowed to say what they want and let people listen, but what people do when they hear the message is up to the people and the people alone.\n\nIn some extreme cases, hate speech *will* be removed, or in other words, the opinion of the speaker is being censored. This in most cases can be seen as a consequence of the impact of the message, not the idea the message carries itself. Once again, they have fully been able to voice their opinion, and it is not being silenced by some tyrannical regime, but has rather been removed due to active harm that is being caused to others. Does it not make sense that if a message online is hypothetically teaching children how to make explosives that cause property damage, it would be removed and erased? This is simply correct not because it is censoring a message of being able to defend yourself, but because it is hurting landowners and the kids it influences. There is always a line, and though the edges near that line can be blurry, someone has to be able to apply moral judgement to the outcome of messages as to prevent easily preventable actions.\n\nIn conclusion, freedom of speech is a wonderful right that should apply to us all, including allowing the use of any kind of speech. This being said, hate speech can and will be removed from certain platforms if it is actively causing harm, an image the platforms would not like to convey, and people are welcome to find other ways to express their opinions. People disagreeing with an opinion is clearly not a violation of your freedom of speech, as encouraged discourse is the whole idea behind the concept, and people of all ages should be free to form their own opinions with all information available to them.","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T08:56:34.808087311Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/Transition-Period/Interesting-English-Language-Articles":{"title":"Interesting English Language Articles","content":"\n#englang #research\n1. The Scots Language\n\tThis is a really interesting article I found through [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP-PV9ryXM4) by xidnaf, and it talked about when a language actually becomes a different language. The line seems to be *really* blurry surprisingly.\n\t\n\tThe video mentions that linguists actually split languages by mutual intelligibility, so if people can understand each other even though some words are different or dialects/accents are different, the language is the same.\n\t\n\tThis still has its own problems though, because for example the Chinese \"languages\" are referred to as dialects even though they can't exactly understand each other, but they still use the same writing system, so you're in the weird position of they speak different languages, but they write in the same one ¬Ø\\\\\\_(„ÉÑ)\\_/¬Ø\n\t\n\tDialect Continuums are also a thing which is cool, overall there's just quite a big range. Australian people might struggle to understand British people, not a different language, but could still maybe understand a *few* loan words in Arabic or such, and the range varies such as English with German etc.\n\t\n\tIt's also not symmetrical e.g. people from Denmark can understand people from Sweden a lot better than vice versa.\n\t\n\tAll in all, what even is a different language is basically up to what we call it, and in the end it's basically all politics funnily enough.\n\t\n\tAnd now we get the Scots Language! It split from Old English similar to modern English, which was spoken about 1000 years ago in Britain. This is completely seperate to Scottish mind you, but is rather a remnant of what Old English was like.\n\t\n\tHere's a demonstration of the Scot's Language which can be found [here](https://youtu.be/cENbkHS3mnY) and helped demonstrate the concept of mutual intelligibility, which is quite common in other places but not so much for native English speakers\n\t \n\thttps://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/scots-language\n\n2. Why is the letter w so weird?\n\tLike isn't it so odd that it's like double u, but it's not even shaped like that, like where did that come from??\n\thttps://youtu.be/sg2j7mZ9-2Y\n\thttps://www.rd.com/article/why-w-is-pronounced-double-u-and-not-double-v/\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T08:56:34.808087311Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/Transition-Period/The-Eloquent-Ape":{"title":"The Eloquent Ape","content":"\n#englang #article\n![[The Eloquent Ape.pdf]]\n\nLanguage is like code, encoded in certain patterns of actions like vocal noises, which are then decoded to decypher meaning by someone else.\nOur ability to communicate is founded on not only our larger brains and ability to control our facial muscles, but also our need for complex social behaviours such as the ability to negotiate, trade and bargain.","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T08:56:34.808087311Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/What-is-a-Language/Features-of-Language":{"title":"Features of Language","content":"#englang #notes \n\n## Spontaneity and Displacement\n### Spontaneity\nHumans have the ability to initiate speech. Unlike animals that need a stimulus such a biscuit or a treat to be forced to speak, humans speak by themselves and start conversations themselves.\n### Displacement\nHumans also have the ability to talk about things that are not in the present moment. This means that they can talk about something that happened lats week, or something that is happening somewhere else right now. This is similar to object perminance, having the ability to communicate beyond the here and now.\n\n## Arbitrariness\nIn general, human language is quite arbitrary. There is nothing about language that neccessarily symbolises something. There is nothing about the sound \"tree\" that links to the thing outside which is brown and green; it is all random. Though there are exceptions, the most common of which being onomatopoeic words such as *whoosh*, *slurp*, *pop* and so on, most words in general are arbitrary.\n\n## Structure and Creativity\nHuman language is an open system that can be added to and combined and recombined in many ways to create new forms. Random units of sound which don't have meaning in of themselves combine to form meaningful morphemes or words. Animals generally don't have this ability, where one sound means one action, and cannot be split up into individual pieces to be reconstructed. Male grasshoppers have the ability to say one of 6 messgages; humans have the ability to talk about literally anything we want.

It is not genetic and instinctual like a dog barking, who will bark the same wherever they go, but is rather learnt from the environment. A cantonese born child growing up in an English speaking house will speak English, it is not something defined inherantly but by the people around the child. Similarly, a bird isolated from any contact will still sing songs, but humans isolated from any society will not be able to speak any languages until they start learning from contact with people around them.","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T08:56:34.868088328Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/What-is-a-Language/Variables-of-Communication":{"title":"Variables of Communication","content":"#englang #notes\n\nIn [[notes/School Subjects/English Language/English Language|English Language]] Units 1 - 4 we will be using these variables to annotate texts:\n## Mode\nThe medium of communication\n- **Written**\n- **Spoken**\n- **Sign**\n## Register\nFormality and respect level, the way a person speaks in respect to their audience\n- **Intimate**: people you know really well, close\n- **Casual**: the way we speak every day to one another, varies from more formal to less in of itself\n- **Consultative**: where there is an uneven power relationship, i.e. doctor patient, student teacher\n- **Formal**: one way, so a speech or letter. maybe meeting the queen lol\n- **Frozen**: things that don't change, such a marriage ceremony, beginning of a sermon, starting of a high court, welcome to country\n## Context\nEstablished background/circumstance, situation surrounding text\n- Situational\n- Cultural\n- Historical\n## Audience\nThe demographic that your are speaking to\n## Function\nPurpose of communication, what we are hoping to gain\n- What is the text set out to do\n- Social purpose, e.g. building rapport, encouraging group membership\n## Field\nHow specialised the communication is, area of interest + subject area\n## Setting\nWhere the communication is taking place\n\n\u003cmark style=\"background: #F9C74F;\"\u003e# MR CAFS\u003c/mark\u003e","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T08:56:34.868088328Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/What-is-a-Language/What-is-a-Language":{"title":"What is a Language?","content":"\n#englang #research \n## Definition 1\n### Source: [Language Meaning \u0026 Concept | What is Language? - Video \u0026 Lesson Transcript | Study.com](https://study.com/learn/lesson/language-meaning-concept.html)\n### Definition:\nEssentially, language is a term for any complex communication system used by humans that consists of words and phrases that, when combined, can create infinite variable utterances. How humans initially developed language is not wholly clear and is something that linguists are still researching. Most humans learn at least one language in early childhood. If a person lacks exposure to language as a young child, they will never be able to fluently learn a language as an adult because of how human brain development works.\n\n---\n## Definition 2\n### Source: [What is Language | IGI Global](https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/using-lean-method-in-english-language-classes/16613)\n### Definition:\nSystem for the expression of thoughts, feelings, etc., by the use of spoken sounds or convention symbols.\n\n---\n## Definition 3\n### Source: [what is language? : linguistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/bw37zc/what_is_language/)\n### Definition:\nA language is defined as a being an open system of communication. In other words, new symbols can be freely added to the system. For example, if I say that I define \"vlirsnik\" to mean \"the feeling of learning something new\" I can add it to this system of communication we are using right now and you will be able to understand it. Therefore, this is a language.\n\n---\n## What is common to your three definitions?\nAll three of the definitions mention that languages are a communication system, that try to express thoughts, ideas and feelings. They also mention that they have a common set of conventions that allow for a practically infinite set of meanings to be added.\n\n---\n## In your own words explain the word \"language\"\nA language is a set of communication standards that aim to convey meaning in the form of ideas, concepts, thoughts and feelings. This is done in a way that ideas can be added to these said conventions to be able to convey new concepts that were previously not expressible, therefore being modular in its usage.","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T08:56:34.868088328Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/Literature":{"title":"Literature","content":"\n#lit #subject \n## Unit 1\n### AoS 1: The Penelopiad\n- Read an extract from [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/A Thousand Ships Extract|A Thousand Ships]] and annotate, and then compare and contrast it with [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Calliope and the Painting|a painting]]\n- Read [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Chapters/Chapter 1|Chapter 1]] of The Penelopiad and write about how [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Atwood|Atwood]] comments on [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Culture \u0026 Society- The Penelopiad|Culture and Society]]\n- Write a short 200 word essay on a quote from [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Chapters/Chapter 6|Chapter 6]]\n- Write about the maids' [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Cold Eyed Teenaged Killer|cold eyed teenaged killer]], Telemachus\n- Write a [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/The Obstacle To Go Through|creative piece]] on Chapter 6\n- Do a close passage analysis on [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/The Birth of Telemachus Close Analysis|the birth of Telemachus]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T08:56:34.868088328Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/A-Thousand-Ships-Extract":{"title":"A Thousand Ships Extract","content":"#lit #flashwrite \n\n\u003e Comment on the author's use of tone and voice of the character Calliope in this extract.\n\nThe author makes Calliope's voice quite direct, using a lot of short clauses which comment on her own emotions and the state of the world around her. This observational tone combined with propositions such as, \"Perhaps he hasn't thought of what it is like to be me,\" allow the extract to form a clear image of how Calliope feels in the situation she describes: she is not understood and she is alone in her suffering. She questions her reality a lot, the need for it and the purpose behind it.

She feels sad that her life never amounted to too much, but she is determined now to tell her story when she can. She says now that no one cares, that it didn't matter at all, but she's waited for so long that she can finally find a little bit of motivation because there is nothing left to lose. \n\nShe is also almost slightly resentful towards Odysseus. She talks about his characters and how she was played the fool, holding a bit of a grudge but condemning herself for not acting on it sooner. \"I turned a blind eye, I kept my mouth shut or if I opened it, I sang his praises\". This rescinded tone, where she sounds so defeated and tired doesn't see herself as anyone perfect but is rather very self critical.

In the text, marriage is mandatory, not being a choice of the bride at all but rather something she has to live through for the rest of her life without her own approval. Penelope's mother implies that life will always keep throwing obstacles at Penelope, one after the other, but she has to smarter than what she faces and find a way to get around it, to live through what comes her way using her \"one redeeming quality\", her brain.\n\nThe quote shows that the world that the text is set in is far from favourable to the women in it, expecting them all to be happy with what is given to them while demanding docility. Penelope's mother is well versed in this world of hardships that cannot be expressed on her face, having to be dealt with behind a facade, so she advises her child to do the same: to use her smarts to outwit the challenge of marriage that comes her way, and to try and live happily despite the unideal scenario the world places her in against her own will.","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T08:56:34.868088328Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/Cold-Eyed-Teenaged-Killer":{"title":"Cold Eyed Teenaged Killer","content":"#lit #flashwrite \n\n\u003e [!question] \n\u003e \n\u003e How and why does Atwood compare the maids and their \"cold eyed teenaged killer\", Telemachus? 200 words\n\nAtwood makes the comparison between Telemachus and the maids, highlighting parallels, stating that they were \"infants when he was an infant, wailing just as he wailed, helpless as he was helpless, but ten times more helpless as well\".

This metaphor of the Three Fatal Sisters explores the idea that the ability to change one's fate is inherently linked with power, and those who are the bottom of the hierarchy can't change anything no matter how much they tried because nothing would change. \n\nThe maids and Telemachus are the same, but yet just due to their birth they are fated completely seperate lives.","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T08:56:34.868088328Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/Culture-Society-The-Penelopiad":{"title":"Culture \u0026 Society- The Penelopiad","content":"#lit #flashwrite #thepenelopiad \n\n\u003e In re-writing The Penelopiad, what assumptions and ideas about culture and society is Atwood seeking to question?\n\n[[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Atwood|Atwood]] aims to question the idea that there is one true tale for the events of a story.

Atwood uses the chapter to express the idea that women are so often left behind and discarded in relationships, with Odysseus just leaving with not much more than a word, causing everything to blur into one monotonous cycle. All she did was wait for news in of Odysseus, further pushing the idea that her only worth is in relation to him.\n\nThe chapter also explores the idea that men have no consequences for their actions, and that anything they do will be glorified and portrayed as a wonderful tale, whereas the women's actions will never be credited to them, simply given to the man who did nothing. Atwood describes a Penelope who dreams of a day, \"Odysseus returning and \\[her] - with womanly modesty - revealing to him how well \\[she] had done at what was usually considered a man's business. On his behalf, of course\". It all had to be on his behalf, because within the text women have no voice at all or any individuality when removed for their male counterpart. Unlike Penelope, Odysseus could do anything, flirt with anyone, even Helen who \"had bathed him and anointed him with her very own hands\" and there were meant to be no consequences, because he can do whatever he pleases.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T08:56:34.868088328Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/The-Birth-of-Telemachus-Close-Analysis":{"title":"The Birth of Telemachus Close Analysis","content":"#lit #flashwrite #analysis\n\n\u003e [!info] \n\u003e \n\u003e Comment on how the passage illustrates the theme of power and powerlessness\n\nThroughout the passage, Atwood uses the motif of water and ocean to represent the power dynamic of the world she has built. The ones who hold the power, Telemachus, Odysseus, the Gods, all use water as a medium to enact their will. Telemachus' birth was not just a birth, it was a \"nine-month voyage\" to be celebrated, as was the great tale of Odysseus who travelled the many seas with great feats. At the same time, Atwood uses the metaphor of water to show how helpless those without power can be. The same power of the ocean just spat the maid out, \"beached at the same time he was\". They were simply spat out, discarded and sub-human, with words such as spawned and appeared describing their inherent inhumanity.\n\nAtwood also uses a combination of anaphora and juxtaposition to directly compare Telemachus and the maids. \"**Infants** when he was an **infant**, **wailing** just as he **wailed**,\" a repetition of the same words to emphasise the point that they apply to directly both the maids and Telemachus. At the same time, the enjambment of lines such as \"wailing just\" and \"as he wailed\" makes the reading more uncomfortable, expressing the idea that though they are identical in almost every way, the wail of a prince is still not equal to the wail of a servant girl. \n\nAtwood uses this mechanism to comment on an important aspect of our modern society: all children are born the same and equal, but it is society's ideals that create imbalance. The environment around Telemachus, not Telemachus himself, is what caused his wail to be any different from the others, and when he grows up being told he is entitled to a kingdom and the lives of those within it, he thus believes so, evident by Penelope's description in Chapter 15, that ‚Äú\\[Telemachus] was starting to look at \\[her] in an odd way, holding \\[her] responsible for the fact that his inheritance was being literally gobbled up.‚Äù \n\nThe excessive use of pronouns in this passage also creates the effect of dehumanising everyone involved. The maids, as always are referred to as a collective, but Telemachus is also never referred to by name, rather as a mysterious \"he\". This lack of definitive character portrays Telemachus as someone who is much more sinister than otherwise, an amalgamation and representation of the power imbalance in their world, causing him to be the antagonist in this poem. The repetitive use of short quick phrases and many verbs also gives the reader a sense that the maids are *objects* built for doing things with, further commenting on the humanity of this conglomeration of broken, unwanted children.","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T08:56:34.868088328Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/The-Obstacle-To-Go-Through":{"title":"The Obstacle To Go Through","content":"#lit #thepenelopiad #flashwrite \n\n\u003e [!quote]\n\u003e \n\u003e \"It's hope, and hope only, that keeps us afloat.\" (Chapter 7 The Chorus Line: If I Was a Princess, A Popular Tune)\n\n**Water**, crashing against the hull of our fate as we hurl further and further into the ocean's **waves**.

Oh how I wish I had the hope she did.*\n\n*This nameless girl, the girl of hopes and dreams, she frolicked around the paddocks and fields, until one day she met a man. Now they frolicked together instead, a pair of inseparable nature, the hope gleaming from one to the other, until one day, he got down on one knee and asked the question every girl wants to here: \"Will you be mine?\"*\n\n*She said yes, but like us all, she didn't realise.

A sound wave is emitted from a speaker and heard by Lee who is 50m from the speaker. He made several statements once he heard the sound. Which one or more of the following statements made by Lee would be correct? Explain your answers.\n\t- **A**: Hearing a sound wave tells me that air particles have travelled from the speaker to me.\n\t- **\u003cmark style=\"background: #FFF3A3A6;\"\u003eB\u003c/mark\u003e**: Air particles carried energy with them as they travelled from the speaker to me.\n\t- **\u003cmark style=\"background: #FFF3A3A6;\"\u003eC\u003c/mark\u003e**: Energy has been transferred from the speaker to me.\n\t- **\u003cmark style=\"background: #FFF3A3A6;\"\u003eD\u003c/mark\u003e**: Energy has been transferred from the speaker to me by the oscillation of air particles.\n\t- Explanation: The particles do not have a net transfer of matter but do transfer energy from the speaker to Lee\n7. A mechanical wave may be described as transverse or longitudinal. In a transverse wave, how does the motion of the particles compare with the direction of travel of the wave?\n   - In a transverse wave, the motion of the particles is perpendicular to the direction of the wave \n8. Classify the waves described below as either longitudinal or transverse:\n\t- **A**: sound waves - longitudinal\n\t- **B**: a vibrating guitar string - transverse\n\t- **C**: slinky moved with an upward pulse - transverse\n\t- **D**: slinky pushed forwards and backwards - longitudinal\n9. Mechanical waves generally travel faster in solids than in gases. Provide an explanation for this.\n   - The particles of the solid are packed closer to each other, meaning that the speed of the oscillations can be faster with same amount of energy due to the smaller distance that has to be travelled for the particles to change direction\n10. For the wave shown below, describe the direction of energy transfer of the sound between the tuning fork and point X. Justify your answer.\n\t- The direction of energy transfer is parallel to the point of the sound's origin, meaning it will move directly from the tuning fork to point X","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T08:56:34.872088395Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Physics/WCCC/WCCC-3":{"title":"WCCC 3","content":"#physics #wccc #refraction\n\n\u003e [!question]\n\u003e \n\u003e Light is incident on a piece of glass.
