In the traditional use of lists as ADTs in algorithms and coding languages, only the first and last item of a list may be viewed, updated and deleted. However, this is not strictly implemented in all coding languages, including Snap! and Snap/Edgy. Unlike mathematical sets, ADT lists can have repeated values.\n\n## Array #card \nAn **array** is a collection of similar items in a **fixed length**, non-expandable structure of items that are accessible by index position.\n\n## Stack #card \nA stack is a collection of similar items where item access is restricted for viewing (top/peek), adding (push) and deleting (pop) at one end of the stack only, referred to as the **top of the stack**. Items are accessed in order Last In First Out (LIFO).\n\n## Queue #card \nA **queue** is a collection of similar items where item access is restricted for viewing and deleting (dequeuing) from the front of the queue, while new items can only be added (enqueued) to the back of the queue. Items are accessed in the order First In First Out (FIFO).\n\n## Priority Queue #card \nA **priority queue** is a collection of similar items where each item is assigned a ranking or priority that determines its importance or urgency. Access is restricted for viewing and deleting from the front of the priority queue. New items, when added, move forward in the priority queue according to the priority ranking given to the item.\n\nPriority queues can be **minimum ranking**, where the smallest priority item goes further to the front of the priority queue, or they can be **maximum ranking**, where the largest priority item goes further to the front of the priority queue.\n\n## Dictionary #card \nA **dictionary**, also known as an **associated array**, is an information structure of \u003ckey, value\u003e pairs where the 'key' is used to access the 'value' items, which give more detailed information related to the 'key'.\n\n## List/Array Signatures #card\n![[List Signature.png]]","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.21831899Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Algorithmics/Algorithmics":{"title":"Algorithmics","content":"#algo #subject \n\n## Unit 1\n- Week 1: Complete [[3.1 HW Graph Worksheet.pdf|3 Tasks]] (here's [[Task 3]])\n\t- Modelled [[Goat Cabbage Wolf Hunter]]\n- Week 2: [[Writing Pseudocode|Introduction to Pseudocode]] with [[Sweet Treats Pseudocode|Sweet Treats]]\n\t- Also modelled [[Locker Door Problem]]\n- Introduction to ADTs.\n- Week 3: \n  - Lesson 1: \n    - [[Graphs as ADTs]]\n    - [[Bridge Crossing Problem]]\n  - Week 4:\n    - [[Glossary|Key Graph Terminology]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.21831899Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Algorithmics/Glossary":{"title":"Glossary","content":"#algo \n\n## How do you notate a graph? #card\nA **graph $G=(V,E)$** is a set of vertices $V(G)$, a set of edges $E(G)$, and a relation that associates two vertices via an edge.\n^1678270591198\n\n## Adjacent Nodes #card\nTwo vertices $v$ and $w$ in graph $G$ are **adjacent**, denoted $v-w$, if there is an edge between them.\n^1678270591202\n\n## Incident #card \nIf the vertex v is an endpoint of the edge e, then e and v are **incident**.\n^1678270591203\n\n## Degree #card \nThe **degree** d(v) of a vertex v is the number of edges incident to it, counting loops twice.\n^1678270591204\n\n## Path #card \nA path is a trail in which neither vertices nor edges are repeated.

For example, in this graph, C can get to any other node in 2 moves, so the radius would be 2.\n![[Radius Diagram.png]]\n^1678327509210\n\n## Eccentricity #card\nThe eccentricity is of a vertex is the maximum distance between the vertex and any other vertex.

Add the initial node to the **queue** and mark it as **seen**.\n2.  Remove the next element from the **queue** and call it **current**.\n3.  Get all neighbours of the **current** node that are not yet marked as **seen**.\n4.  Store all these neighbours into the **queue** and mark them all as **seen**.\n5.  Repeat steps **2 - 4** until the **queue** becomes empty.\n![[Graph Algorithms.png]]\n^1684293406145\n\n## Depth First Search (DFS) #card\nDFS is a graph traversal algorithm that chooses any single neighbour node for each discovered node and proceeds searching from it. This produces long branches, because searching from other neighbours is only carried out once a branch has been fully explored.\n- Design Pattern: Decrease \u0026 Conquer ∵ grows MST by cheapest edge possible that does not make a cycle\n**DFS algorithm step-by-step**\n1.  Add the initial node to the **stack**.\n2.  Remove the next element from the **stack** and call it **current**.\n3.  If the **current** node was **seen** then skip it (go to step **6**).\n4.  Otherwise mark the **current** node as **seen**.\n5.  Get all neighbours of the **current** node and add all of them to the **stack**.\n6.  Repeat steps **2 - 5** until the **stack** becomes empty.\n**Difference from BFS**\n-   We use a **stack** instead of the **queue** for storing nodes.\n-   Typically we do not check whether a node was **seen** when storing neighbours in the stack – instead we perform this checking when retrieving the node from it.\n^1684293406148\n\n## Applications of DFS and BFS #card \n-   DFS and BFS will both give information about whether one node is connected to another via any path in a graph.\n-   If the graph **is** connected, BFS will visit all of its nodes.\n-   The traversal tree built by BFS represents the shortest paths from the initial vertex to any other for an unweighted graph.\n-   DFS is unsuitable for searching shortest paths for unweighted graphs.\n^1684293406149\n\n## Graph Colouring #card \nGraph colouring or vertex colouring is the process of colouring a graph such that no adjacent vertices have the same colour. A $k$-colouring of a graph uses $k$ colours, and the chromatic number is the minimum value of $k$ for which a $k$ colouring exists.\nApplications are generally to resolve conflicts, where certain objects cannot be next to each other or certain events cannot run at the same time.\nThese generally end up being **optimal resource allocation** problems.\n^1684293406150\n\n## Detecting Cycles #card \nDFS is used to detect cycles! With a small modification to DFS to maintain a list of visited nodes as well as processed nodes, DFS can detect cycles, and if a we visit a node we have already visited, a cycle is detected.\n^1684293406151\n\n## Topological Sorting #card \nThe DFS order of the processed list is the topological sorting, normally run from a source node. \nOne problem that can be solved by divide and conquer is topological sorting. **Topological sorting** is the ordering of information according to its dependencies and is typically represented by a directed graph showing the order of progress for a particular system.\n^1684293406152\n\n## Shortest Path in Unweighted Graphs #card \nBFS is used to find the shortest path in unweighted graphs from one node to another. By rippling out in layers from the starting node, it can find the first path to the end node.\n^1684293406153\n\n## Spanning Tree #card \nA **spanning tree** is a connected graph that has no circuits or cycles and which includes all the vertices or nodes of a graph.\nA **minimum spanning tree** (MST) is a spanning tree for a weighted graph whose edges add up to the smallest possible value.\n^1684293406154\n\n## Prim's Algorithm #card \n**Prim's Algorithm** is a greedy algorithm used for finding the MST in weighted undirected graphs.\n- Design Pattern: Marks each processed node and reduces problem sizer by one node in each iteration until all nodes processed\n**Prim's algorithm in plain English**\n1.  Begin at any vertex.\n2.  Select the **cheapest** (minimum-weight) edge emanating from the vertex.\n3.  Look at edges coming from the vertices selected so far: select the cheapest edge; if the edge forms a circuit, discard it and select the next cheapest.\n4.  Repeat until all vertices have been selected.\n5.  Double-check by repeating the process with a different starting vertex.\n^1684293406155\n\n## Dijkstra's Algorithm #card \nDijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from the starting location to any other location, not just the desired destination. The algorithm works on weighted graphs and weighted digraphs, **where no negative weight cycles exist.** \nDijkstra's algorithm is a **greedy** algorithm – that is, one that starts at a given source node in a weighted graph and expands all possible paths from this node using the weights on the edges to all the immediate neighbours. It then repeats this process from the cheapest-cost neighbour at this point in the algorithm. \nAs it calculates the shortest path, it marks nodes that have been explored and expanded to their immediate neighbours as 'visited' until all the nodes in the graph have been explored, processed, expanded and visited.\nWhen all nodes have been processed, the shortest path from the source node will have been calculated for all the other nodes in the graph.\n```\nWhile there are unvisited vertices do\n  find the vertex (V) with the smallest distance in the unvisited vertices list\n  remove V from the unvisited vertices list\n  for each neighbour (N) of vertex V do\n    thisDist:=distance to V plus the weight of the edge V-N\n    if thisDist \u003c distance to N then\n      A shorter path to N has been found\n      Update the shortest path to N distance to N := thisDist\n      set the shortest path predecessor to N as V\n^1684293406156\n\n    End if\n  End do\nEnd do\n```\n\n## Bellman-Ford Algorithm #card \nBellman-Ford, like Dijkstra's uses relaxation to find the shortest path, but it can also *detect* that a negative cycle exists. It will not be able to find the shortest path if this cycle exists. This being said, Bellman-Ford *works* on graphs with negative edge weights, but not negative cycles.\n**Unlike Dijkstra’s algorithm, the Bellman-Ford algorithm is not greedy and does not use a priority queue to process the edges.**\n^1684293406157\n\n## Dijkstra's vs Bellman-Ford vs Floyd-Warshall #card \n- Dijkstra's: shortest path from **one** node to all nodes\n- Bellman-Ford: shortest path from **one** node to all nodes, negative edges **allowed**\n- Floyd-Warshall's Shortest Path: shortest path between **all** pairs of vertices, negative edges allowed\nNegative cycles are not allowed in any of these algorithms, because shortest path doesn't make sense for negative cycles.\n^1684293406158\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.222319167Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Algorithmics/SAT/Garvs-SAT-Friendship-Network":{"title":"Algorithmics SAT - Friendship Network","content":"\nThe general problem of planning trips with friends can be made more specific by considering scenarios for hangouts. In this particular scenario, my friends have decided that we want to travel in one big travel party and I will start and end my day at my house, picking up all my friends along the way. This form of hangout is quite common with my friends, where we pick up people along the way to get to a final destination.\nThe algorithm will find the quickest route to pick up all my friends, go to our desired location(s), and drop them all off before I go back to my own house. It will then return to me the traversal path, the time taken, and my cost for transport throughout the day.\n\n## Information to Consider\n\nThe following is key information to consider when modelling the real life problem. This will be done by representing the problem with an undirected network/graph, as all public transport methods go both ways, just at different times depending on the transport method.\n\n### Node Representation\n\nNodes represent key landmarks such as train stations, bus stops or a tourist attraction.\n\n### Edge Representation\n\nEdges represent a route (train, bus, tram, walking, etc) from one location to another\n\n### Weight Representation\n\nThe edge weights will represent:\n\n- the time taken to travel from one house to the other\n- the financial cost of the route, with buses being more expensive than trains, which are more expensive than walking, etc. These can be interchanged to prioritise the certain attribute, such as time or money being of higher importance in the algorithm.\n\n### Additional Information Modelled Outside Graph\n\nThe following would be modelled as dictionaries:\n\n- The arrival time/timetable of buses and trains\n- The cost of changing lines\n- Attributes of each friend, such as name, home, the time they wake up, the amount of time they take to get ready, and who is friends with whom or to what degree.\n- Proximity to all friends' houses (by walking), which would be a dictionary for each node separately. This information could be used to add further complications to make the model reflect real life more closely, such as different friends being ready earlier than others or requiring a certain number of \"close friends\" (by threshold) to be within the travel party at all times.\n\n## Abstract Data Types\n\nI have selected a number of stations, bus stops and locations which I feel are relevant to my friend group.\n\n| Property                     | Stored as                                                    | Notes                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Key Landmarks                | Node                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Landmark Name                | Node Attribute                                               |                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Route                        | Edge                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Route Name                   | Edge Attribute                                               |                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Transport Method/Line        | Edge Colour                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Time or Cost                 | Edge Weight                                                  | These can be interchanged to prioritise different aspects.

In other words, the shortest cost circuit that will visit every node that is needed to be visited to pick up my friends.\n\nWhile researching into how to solve this, I found that this was a classic example of the travelling salesman problem, which turns out to be an NP-hard problem. This means that there currently exists no exact solution to the problem in polynomial time, and the best I can currently do is the Held–Karp algorithm, which has a time complexity of $O(n^{2}2^{n})$ which is not ideal at all in terms of efficiency, but will have to be sufficient for the use cases of this project.\n\n### Node Selection Algorithm\n\nBefore we can find the shortest circuit that visits a set of nodes, we need to know what nodes to visit in the first place!\nEach node, which is part of the public transport network, can be assigned latitude and longitude coordinates, and these can be compared with the coordinates of each of my friends' houses to determine the shortest distance they would need to walk to reach a transport hub that is represented as a node on our graph.\n\nThe process of finding the nodes can then $\\therefore$ be represented as the following informal steps:\n1. Get the latitude and longitude coordinates of all transport hubs and friends' houses.\n2. Loop over all friends and transport hubs, comparing the distance of each to find the closest transport hub to each friend.\n3. Finally store each friends' closest transport hub and distance into their respective dictionary entries.\n\nThe question still remains though: how can we find the distance between two lat/long coordinates? The answer is the [haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula)!\n\n#### The Haversine Formula\n\nThe haversine formula determines the distance between two points on a sphere given their latitude and longitude coordinates. Using the distance formula $\\sqrt{(y_{2}-y_{1})^2+(x_{2}-x_{1})^2}$ may be sufficient in terms of finding the closest transport hub, but the distances it provides only work on a flat cartesian plane, not spheres like the earth, distances which could be used for later computation such as time taken to walk to the transport hubs.\n\nThe haversine formula can be rearranged given that the Earth's radius is 6371km to give us the following equation (with $d$ representing the distance between two locations):\n\n$\\Delta lat=lat_{1}-lat_2$\n$\\Delta long=long{1}-long_2$\n$R=6371$\n\n$a = \\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\Delta lat}{2}) + \\cos(lat_{1})\\cos(lat_{2})\\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\Delta long}{2})$\n$c = 2\\operatorname{atan2}(\\sqrt{a}, \\sqrt{1-a})$\n$d = R\\times c$\n\nIt *is* somewhat long on not the cleanest formula, but it should be more than sufficient in our code.\n\n#### Pseudocode\n\nFinally we can use the informal steps above to construct the following pseudocode:\n```\ndistance_dict: dictionary = {}\n\nfunction calculate_nodes (\n\tfriend_data: dictionary,\n\tnode_data: dictionary\n):\n\tfor friend in friend_data:\n\t\thome: tuple = friend['home']\n\t\t// initial min vals that will be set to smallest iterated distance\n\t\tmin: float = infinity\n\t\tmin_node: node = null\n\t\t\n\t\tfor node in node_data:\n\t\t\tlocation: tuple = node['coordinates']\n\t\t\t// find real life distance (functional abstraction)\n\t\t\tdistance: float = latlong_distance(home, location)\n\t\t\tif distance \u003c min:\n\t\t\t\tmin = distance\n\t\t\t\tmin_node = node\n\t\t\n\t\tdistance_dict[friend]['min_node'] = min_node\n\t\tdistance_dict[friend]['distance'] = min\nend function\n```\n\nThis combines the haversine formula and simple iteration to find the minimum distance node for each and stores it into a dictionary. When translated to Python, the above code looks like this:\n```python\ndef lat_long_distance(coord1, coord2):\n    # assign lat/long from coords\n    lat1 = coord1[0]\n    long1 = coord1[1]\n    lat2 = coord2[0]\n    long2 = coord2[1]\n\n    # radius of earth\n    r = 6371\n\n    # equation definitions from haversine formula\n    phi_1 = math.radians(lat1)\n    phi_2 = math.radians(lat2)\n\n    delta_phi = math.radians(lat2 - lat1)\n    delta_lambda = math.radians(long2 - long1)\n\n    a = math.sin(delta_phi / 2.0) ** 2 + math.cos(phi_1) * math.cos(phi_2) * math.sin(delta_lambda / 2.0) ** 2\n\n    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1 - a))\n\n    # distance in kilometers\n    d = r * c\n\n    return d\n\n\ndef calculate_nodes(friend_data, node_data):\n    distance_dict = {}\n    for friend in friend_data:\n        friend_home = friend_data[friend]['home']\n        # initial min vals that will be set to smallest iterated distance\n        min_dist = float('inf')\n        closest_node = None\n\n        for node in node_data:\n            location = node_data[node]\n            distance = lat_long_distance(friend_home, location)\n            if distance \u003c min_dist:\n                min_dist = distance\n                closest_node = node\n\n        distance_dict[friend] = {}\n        distance_dict[friend]['closest_node'] = closest_node\n        distance_dict[friend]['distance'] = min_dist\n    return distance_dict\n```\n\nThe output of this code on our data set is as follows:\n```\n{\n    'Garv': {'min_node': 'Brandon Park', 'distance': 0.4320651871428905},\n    'Grace': {'min_node': 'Caulfield', 'distance': 3.317303898425856},\n    'Sophie': {'min_node': 'Camberwell', 'distance': 10.093829041341555},\n    'Zimo': {'min_node': 'CGS WH', 'distance': 1.0463628559819804},\n    'Emma': {'min_node': 'Wheelers Hill Library', 'distance': 2.316823113596007},\n    'Sabrina': {'min_node': 'CGS WH', 'distance': 1.0361159593717744},\n    'Audrey': {'min_node': 'CGS WH', 'distance': 6.99331705920331},\n    'Eric': {'min_node': 'Glen Waverley', 'distance': 2.591823985420863},\n    'Isabella': {'min_node': 'CGS WH', 'distance': 2.048436485663766},\n    'Josh': {'min_node': 'CGS WH', 'distance': 0.656799522332077},\n    'Molly': {'min_node': 'Wheelers Hill Library', 'distance': 7.559508844793643},\n    'Avery': {'min_node': 'Mount Waverley', 'distance': 6.312529532145972},\n    'Sammy': {'min_node': 'Brandon Park', 'distance': 3.408577759087159},\n    'Natsuki': {'min_node': 'CGS WH', 'distance': 6.419493747390275},\n    'Liam': {'min_node': 'Mount Waverley', 'distance': 0.8078481833574709},\n    'Nick': {'min_node': 'Glen Waverley', 'distance': 1.3699143560496139},\n    'Will': {'min_node': 'Wheelers Hill Library', 'distance': 6.404888550878483},\n    'Bella': {'min_node': 'Wheelers Hill Library', 'distance': 0.7161158445537555}\n}\n```\nIf it takes any of my friends' more than 20 minutes to walk to their transport location, I'd probably want a little warning advising me to consider adding closer transport hubs, because that seems like an awfully long time to walk! This can be done by considering the average human walking speed of $5.1 \\textrm{km/h}$. Dividing their distance to transport hubs by this constant should give a good approximation of walking time.\nThis gives the following list of friends that it would be too long for, and we can consider expanding our graph for better results:\n```\nWarning! These 11 friends have to walk more than 20 minutes in order to get to their transport hub. Possibly consider adding hubs closer to their houses:  Grace (39.03), Sophie (118.75), Emma (27.26), Audrey (82.27), Eric (30.49), Isabella (24.1), Molly (88.94), Avery (74.27), Sammy (40.1), Natsuki (75.52) and Will (75.35)\n```\n\n#### Evaluation of Solution\n\nThe solution above works alright for short distances, but slightly breaks apart the further you have to go. This is because humans in the real world have to walk across set designated pathways that the algorithm is not aware of, which is simply calculating the direct distance, which could be walking directly through houses or shopping centres. As such, the distances and times taken for walking are very much approximations in this model that could be further refined by a path finding algorithm that has an awareness of roads and pathways, but as that is an immense amount of data, this approximation will have to suffice for the purposes of this SAT.\n\n### Fare Cost Calculation Algorithm\n\nAs well as the time taken to pick up all my friends, it would be useful for the algorithm to tell me how much the trip costs in ride fairs. PTV uses a \"zoning system\" that charges different for the zones you are in. It also charges a set rate for under 2 hours of travel, and a seperate \"daily rate\" for any more than that:\n\n| 2 hour     | Zone 1 + 2 | Zone 2 |\n| ---------- | ---------- | ------ |\n| Full Fare  | $4.60      | $3.10  |\n| Concession | $2.30      | $1.55  |\n\n| Daily      | Zone 1 + 2 | Zone 2 |\n| ---------- | ---------- | ------ |\n| Full Fare  | $9.20      | $6.20  |\n| Concession | $4.60      | $3.10  |\n\nThere are also caps on public holidays and weekends set to $6.70 for full-fare users and $3.35 to concession users. Zone 0 can be used to denote the free zone as well, or transport methods such as walking or cycling that have no associated cost.\n\nThis can be setup into the following conditional statements in pseudocode to calculate fare prices:\n```\nfunction calculate_prices (\n\tline_data: dictionary,\n\thamiltonian_path: dictionary,\n\tconcession: boolean,\n\tholiday: boolean\n):\n\tzones: set = {}\n\t// add all traversed zones into a set to see which zones were visited\n\tfor node in hamiltonian_path['path']:\n\t\tzones.add(line_data[node['line']]['zone'])\n\t\t\n\tmoney = 0\n\t\n\t// if it took us 2 hours or less\n\tif hamiltonian_path['time'] \u003c= 120:\n\t\t// 2 hour bracket\n\t\tif zones has 1 and 2:\n\t\t\tif concession:\n\t\t\t\tmoney = 2.30\n\t\t\telse:\n\t\t\t\tmoney = 4.60\n\t\telse if zones has 2:\n\t\t\t// just zone 2\n\t\t\tif concession:\n\t\t\t\tmoney = 1.55\n\t\t\telse:\n\t\t\t\tmoney = 3.10\n\telse:\n\t\t// daily fare bracket\n\t\tif zones has 1 and 2:\n\t\t\tif concession:\n\t\t\t\tmoney = 4.60\n\t\t\telse:\n\t\t\t\tmoney = 9.20\n\t\telse if zones has 2:\n\t\t\t// just zone 2\n\t\t\tif concession:\n\t\t\t\tmoney = 3.10\n\t\t\telse:\n\t\t\t\tmoney = 6.20\n\t\n\t// if it is a weekend or a holiday\t\t\t\n\tif holiday:\n\t\tif concession and money \u003e 3.35:\n\t\t\tmoney = 3.35\n\t\telse if money \u003e 6.70:\n\t\t\tmoney = 6.70\n\t\n\treturn money\nend function\n```\n\n### Held-Karp Algorithm\n\nThe Held-Karp algorithm is a method for finding the exact shortest hamiltonian circuit in the exponential time complexity of $O(n^{2}2^{n})$, which is much better than if we to brute force it, which would have a complexity of $O(n!)$.\n\nThe Travelling Salesman problem does not allow us to be greedy, because for us to choose the best choice at any moment, we have to be able to discard all other solutions. TSP is too complex for this, as going down any node may lead to a shorter solution later on. Because of this, solving for the TSP has to use the decrease and conquer principle to make our problem smaller piece by piece, which can be done by recursion or using dynamic programming if the results of operations are saved.\n\nHeld-Karp works by utilising the the following information.\n\nLet $A =$ starting vertex\nLet $B =$ ending vertex\nLet $S = \\{P, Q, R\\}$ or any other vertices to be visited along the way.\nLet $C \\in S$ (random node in $S$)\n\nWe $\\therefore$ know that the minimum cost of going from $A$ to $B$ while visiting all nodes in the set $S$ can be split up into the following two parts:\n- Going from $A$ to $C$ (a random node in $S$) while visiting all nodes in the set $S$ besides $C$\n- Going from $C$ to $B$ directly\nEssentially, this goes through the set $S$ and makes any node $C$ the last node, giving us the same problem with a smaller set. This then allows us to identify that the problem is recursive, as the larger path can be split up into smaller and smaller sub-paths by the above logic, until we reach a base case of $S$ having length 0, where we can then just calculate the direct distance.\n\nTo reiterate more formally: $\\textrm{Cost}_{\\textrm{min}} \\space A \\rightarrow B \\space \\textrm{whilst visiting all nodes in S}$ = $\\textrm{min}(\\textrm{Cost} \\space A \\rightarrow C \\space \\textrm{visiting everything else in S} + d_{CB})$. As such, we can find the smallest cost hamiltonian path by gradually building larger and larger subpaths from the minimum cost to the next node in $S$, using dynamic programming to combine the subpaths to form the larger hamiltonian path.\n\nThis logic leads to the following pseudocode:\n\n```\nfunction held_karp (\n    start: node,\n    end: node,\n    visit: set\u003cnode\u003e\n):\n\t// base case: if no visit set then we can just return direct distance\n    if visit.size = 0:\n        return dist(start, end)\n    else:\n        min = infinity\n        // find the minimum subpath\n        For node C in set S:\n\t        // uses property described above to split larger path into smaller subpath, and solves recursively\n\t        sub_path = held_carp(start, C, (set \\ C))\n\t        cost = sub_path + dist(C, end)\n\t        if cost \u003c min:\n\t            min = cost\n\t    return min\nend function\n```\n\nAfter being implemented in Python (with a slight modification to return the path as well), this pseudocode looks like this:\n\n```python\ndef held_karp(start, end, visit):\n    if type(visit) is not set:\n        print(\"Error: visit must be a set of nodes\")\n        return {'cost': float('inf'), 'path': None}\n    if len(visit) == 0:\n        return {'cost': dist(start, end), 'path': [start, end]}\n    else:\n        minimum = {'cost': float('inf')}\n        for rand_node in visit:\n            sub_path = held_karp(start, rand_node, visit.difference({rand_node}))\n            cost = dist(rand_node, end) + sub_path['cost']\n            if cost \u003c minimum['cost']:\n                minimum = {'cost': cost, 'path': sub_path['path'] + [end]}\n        return minimum\n```\n\n#### The Infinite Distance Problem\nThe problem with this implementation is that it currently only works with complete graphs, where the distance between any two given nodes will not be infinity. This becomes clear if we try and find the cost of going from Oakleigh to Melbourne Central while visiting Caulfield along the way. The pseudocode would choose Caulfield as the value for $C$, as it is the only node in the set. The issue is at line `12`, as the algorithm would try and get the distance between Caulfield and Melbourne Central, but as there is no edge between these two nodes, it will return $\\infty$.\n\nThis can be solved by using [[#dijkstras-algorithm|Dijkstra's Algorithm]], instead of the `dist` function, which will instead find the shortest path (and $\\therefore$ distance) between any two given nodes. (the justification of this specific algorithm selection is evaluated and challenged [[#dijkstras-algorithm-vs-floyd-warshalls-shortest-path-algorithm|here]])\n\nAfter this modification, our hybrid algorithm works great!\n\n```\nLet's say I have 5 friends, they live closest to the following nodes: Caulfield, Mount Waverley, Glen Waverley, Melbourne Central and Chadstone\n\nThe following would be the fastest path to go from my house (Brandon Park) to all my friends' and back:\n\n{'cost': 182, 'path': ['Brandon Park', 'Wheelers Hill Library', 'CGS WH', 'Glen Waverley', 'Mount Waverley', 'Richmond', 'Parliament', 'Melbourne Central', 'Flinders Street', 'Caulfield', 'Chadstone', 'Oakleigh', 'Brandon Park']}\n```\n\n### Dijkstra's Algorithm\n\nDijkstra's Algorithm is a method for finding the shortest path between any two given nodes in a weighted graph, given that the weights are non-negative. If some of the weights were negative, the Bellman-Ford Algorithm could also be used to find the shortest path between two vertices, but as this is not the case for our model (a method of transport cannot take you negative time to get somewhere), Dijkstra's Algorithm is preferred for simplicity.\n\nDijkstra's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm, which actually finds the distance between a node and every other node on the graph. It does this based on the notion that if there were a shorter path than any sub-path, it would replace that sub-path to make the whole path shorter. More simply, shortest paths must be composed of shortest paths, which allows Dijkstra's to be greedy, always selecting the shortest path from \"visited\" nodes, using the principle of relaxation to gradually replace estimates with more accurate values.\n\nDijkstra's Algorithm follows the logic outlined by the following pseudocode:\n\n```\nfunction dijkstras (\n    start: node,\n    end: node,\n    graph: graph\n):\n    // Set all node distance to infinity\n    for node in graph:\n        distance[node] = infinity\n        predecessor[node] = null\n        unexplored_list.add(node)\n    \n    // starting distance has to be 0\n    distance[start] = 0\n    \n    // while more to still explore\n    while unexplored_list is not empty:\n        min_node = unexplored node with min cost\n        unexplored_list.remove(min_node)\n    \n\t    // go through every neighbour and relax\n        for each neighbour of min_node:\n            current_dist = distance[min_node] + dist(min_node, neighbour)\n            // a shorter path has been found to the neighbour -\u003e relax value\n            if current_dist \u003c distance[neighbour]:\n                distance[neighbour] = current_dist\n                predecessor[neighbour] = min_node\n    \n    return distance[end]\nend function\n```\n\nAfter being implemented in Python (with a slight modification to return the path as well), the pseudocode looks like this:\n\n```python\ndef dijkstra(start, end):\n    # set all nodes to infinity with no predecessor\n    distance = {node: float('inf') for node in g.nodes()}\n    predecessor = {node: None for node in g.nodes()}\n    unexplored = list(g.nodes())\n\n    distance[start] = 0\n\n    while len(unexplored) \u003e 0:\n        min_node = min(unexplored, key=lambda node: distance[node])\n        unexplored.remove(min_node)\n\n        for neighbour in g.neighbors(min_node):\n            current_dist = distance[min_node] + dist(min_node, neighbour)\n            # a shorter path has been found to the neighbour -\u003e relax value\n            if current_dist \u003c distance[neighbour]:\n                distance[neighbour] = current_dist\n                predecessor[neighbour] = min_node\n\n    # reconstructs the path\n    path = [end]\n    while path[0] != start:\n        path.insert(0, predecessor[path[0]])\n\n    return {'cost': distance[end], 'path': path}\n```\n\n### Considering Train/Bus Arrival Times \u0026 Switching Lines\n\nEvidently, trains do not leave immediately when you get to the station, and neither do buses. The algorithm thus far assumes no waiting time during transit, and as anyone who has used public transport would know, this is not realistic.\nAs such, the arrival time of trains and buses needs to be considered. This also has the added benefit of factoring in the time it takes to switch lines, as this time is lost waiting for another train or bus.\n\nAll the algorithms above eventually call the `dist` function to get the direct distance between two nodes, which in and of itself is an abstraction of a distance matrix. By taking the input of the current time, the `dist` function can consider how long one must wait for a bus/train to arrive at the node, and modify the edge weights according, returning a larger cost for edges that require long wait times.\n\nThe following `dist` function takes the above into consideration:\n```\nfunction dist (\n\tstart: node,\n\tend: node,\n\tcurrent_time: datetime\n):\t\n\t// if the start and end node are the same, it takes no time to get there\n\tif start = end:\n\t\treturn 0\n\telse if edges = null:\n\t\t// if no edge exists between nodes\n\t\treturn infinity\n\t\n\tedges = edge_lookup_matrix[start][end]\n\tdistances = []\n\t\n\t// go over each possible edge between nodes (multiple possible)\n\tfor edge in edges:\n\t\tline = edge.line\n\t\t// next time bus/train will be at node (functional abstraction)\n\t\tnext_time = soonest_time_at_node(timetable, line, start, current_time)\n\t\twait_time = next_time - current_time\n\t\tdistances.add(edge.weight + wait_time)\n\t\n\treturn min(distances)\nend function\n```\n\nAfter implementing this function, an additional problem is introduced: how can the algorithms that are dependant on `dist` be aware of the current time?\n\n#### Implementing Current Time in Dijkstra's\n\nThe process for keeping track of the current time for Dijkstra's is relatively simple: it will just be the given time of day inputed into Dijkstra's + $n$ amount of minutes, where $n$ is the distance to the `min_node`. As such line 19 from the pseudocode above simply needs to be changed to the following, along with a new input of `current_time`\n```\ncurrent_dist = distance[min_node] + dist(min_node, neighbour, current_time + to_minutes(distance[min_node]))\n```\n\nThis works because distance in our algorithm is analogous to minutes, and since the `dist` function returns the correct distance initially and stores it into the distance array, subsequent calls will be using the correct distance from `distance[min_node]` along with the correct distance from the `dist` function. This informal argument by mathematical induction demonstrates the correctness of this modification, which seems to work well when tested within the algorithm.\n\n#### Implementing Current Time in Held-Karp\n\nFactoring in the current time into Held-Karp follows the same recursive nature as the algorithm itself. First we can change the base case to work with the new Dijkstra's Algorithm outlined above:\n\n```\nif visit.size = 0:\n\tdjk = dijkstras(start, end, current_time)\n\treturn djk['cost']\n```\n\nNow that our base case is returning a cost with the current time factored in, we need to make the sub path on line 11 of the original algorithm also factor in the current time. The current time when the sub_path is created will always be the current time at the start node, which we defined as the time inputed into Held-Karp at initialisation. As such, the line is changed to the following:\n\n```\nsub_path = held_carp(start, C, (set \\ C), current_time)\n```\n\nFinally, the only other change needs to be made on line 12. Previously, we replaced the `dist` function here with `dijkstras` to solve the [[#the-infinite-distance-problem|Infinite Distance Problem]], but Dijkstra's also requires the input of time. As the starting node here is $C$, or the randomly selected node, the current time for this function call would have to be the time when we are at $C$. This can simply be found by treating the distance of `sub_path` as minutes which are added to the current time, as the `sub_path` ends at the same random node $C$. As such, line 12 can be changed to the following:\n\n```\ndjk = dijkstras(C, end, current_time + toMinutes(sub_path['cost']))\ncost = sub_path['cost'] + djk['cost']\n```\n\nThis leaves us with the a sound implementation of Held-Karp factoring in time, demonstrated by the following pseudocode:\n\n```\nfunction held_karp (\n    start: node,\n    end: node,\n    visit: set\u003cnode\u003e,\n    current_time: datetime\n):\n    if visit.size = 0:\n    \tdjk = dijkstras(start, end, current_time)\n\t\treturn djk['cost']\n    else:\n        min = infinity\n        For node C in set S:\n\t        sub_path = held_carp(start, C, (set \\ C), current_time)\n\t        djk = dijkstras(C, end, current_time + toMinutes(sub_path['cost']))\n\t        cost = sub_path['cost'] + djk['cost']\n\t        if cost \u003c min:\n\t            min = cost\n\t    return min\nend function\n```\n\nThis works because of a similar principle to the informal argument for the modified Dijkstra's correctness: it works for the base case (because Dijkstra's works), and it also must work for the $k+1$ case, because the time being inputed into the functions is always the time at the starting nodes. It then $\\therefore$ works for all cases, which seems to also be true when used in practice.\n\n### Dijkstra's Algorithm vs Floyd Warshall's Shortest Path Algorithm\nThe problem that using Dijkstra's was attempting to solve was that Held-Karp treats the distance between two unconnected vertices as $\\infty$, as demonstrated [[#the-infinite-distance-problem|here]].\n\nThere are 3 main shortest path algorithms covered in Unit 3:\n1. Dijkstra's Algorithm: \n   - Shortest path from **one** node to all nodes\n   - Negative edges **not** allowed\n   - Returns **both** path and cost\n2. Bellman-Ford Algorithm:\n   - Shortest path from **one** node to all nodes\n   - Negative edges **allowed**\n   - Returns **both** path and cost\n3. Floyd-Warshall's Shortest Path Algorithm:\n   - Shortest path between **all** pairs of vertices\n   - Negative edges **allowed**\n   - Returns **only** cost\n\nAs we can see, to be able to output the traversal path, we need both the cost and the path, so Floyd-Warshall's was initially discarded because it did not do so, even if it meant that the less desirable solution of running Dijkstra's from every source node had to be used, calculating the shortest path to every other node each time.\n\nThe most optimal solution would be an algorithm that returns both the cost and the traversal order of the shortest path between *all* pairs of vertices, as this operation is carried out many times by Held-Karp.\nImplementing Floyd-Warshall's Shortest Path with the modification of a predecessor matrix (similar to Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra's) was attempted, but this requires additional recursive computation to reconstruct the path, making it not ideal in terms of efficiency.\n\nAn alternative solution, Johnson's Algorithm, is one that gives us the exact output we want: the shortest path and cost between all vertex pairs. The algorithm works by first running Bellman-Ford to account for negative edge weights (not a problem for this SAT) and then runs Dijkstra's from every source node to construct a matrix and paths for each. Surprisingly, this algorithm is comparable to the efficiency of running just normal Floyd-Warshall's, and can even be faster in some cases.\n\nAs such, the only modification that needs to be made is that instead of calling Dijkstra's *every* time a vertex pair distance and path is needed, the whole distance matrix can be constructed at once, so subsequent calls only take $O(1)$ time instead. This can be achieved using dynamic programming, by [[#caching-dijkstras-output|caching the output of Dijkstra's]] whenever it is invoked, so we are only running the algorithm as many times as we need to. \n\n## Optimisations\n\nThe optimisations below were created after the following base case:\n\n```\nLet's say I have 9 friends, they live closest to the following nodes: {'Mount Waverley', 'Melbourne Central', 'Chadstone', 'CGS WH', 'Parliament', 'Wheelers Hill Library', 'Flinders Street', 'Brighton Beach', 'Camberwell'}\nThe following would be the fastest path to go from my house (Brandon Park) to all my friends' and back:\n{'cost': 262, 'path': ['Brandon Park', 'Wheelers Hill Library', 'CGS WH', 'Glen Waverley', 'Mount Waverley', 'Richmond', 'Camberwell', 'Richmond', 'Parliament', 'Melbourne Central', 'Flinders Street', 'Brighton Beach', 'Flinders Street', 'Caulfield', 'Chadstone', 'Oakleigh', 'Brandon Park']}\n\nIt took 47.3621 seconds to run.\n```\n\nAs seen, running the above Held-Karp + Dijkstra's combination took about 50 seconds to calculate the minimal cost path for 9 nodes. The following is a table for $n \\space \\textrm{vs} \\space t$, with an approximate line of best fit of $y \\approx a \\times b^{x}$ where $a=8.1017\\times10^{-8}$ and $b=9.3505$:\n\n| $n$ (no. nodes) | $t$ (execution time in seconds, 4dp) | $y$ (line of best fit, 4dp) |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 0               | 0.0001                               | 0.0000                      |\n| 1               | 0.0002                               | 0.0000                      |\n| 2               | 0.0002                               | 0.0000                      |\n| 3               | 0.0016                               | 0.0001                      |\n| 4               | 0.0083                               | 0.0006                      |\n| 5               | 0.0132                               | 0.0058                      |\n| 6               | 0.1090                               | 0.0541                      |\n| 7               | 0.5674                               | 0.5063                      |\n| 8               | 4.7193                               | 4.7343                      |\n| 9               | 44.2688                              | 44.2680                     |\n\nAnything above 7 nodes takes far too long, and calculating the entire hamiltonian circuit would take 5 weeks 1 day 14 hours 56 mins and 39 secs based on the line of best fit, so the following optimisations have been utilised.\n\n### Caching Dijkstra's Output\n\nWhen replacing the `dist` function with Dijkstra's Algorithm, a certain time compromise was made. `dist` has a time complexity of $O(1)$, simply fetching the distance from the distance matrix, but Dijkstra's Algorithm is relatively slower at $O(E\\log{V})$ where $E$ is the number of edges and $V$ the number of vertices. For our sample graph above, with $E = 27$ and $V = 15$, $O(E\\log{V}) \\approx 31.75$. This makes using Dijkstra's roughly 31 times slower than `dist` as it is called every time.\n\nTo avoid this, we can cache the results of Dijkstra's Algorithm to avoid running the same calculation multiple times. This can be done with the following pseudocode:\n\n```\ncached_djk = dictionary of node -\u003e dict\n\nfunction fetch_djk (\n    start: node,\n    end: node,\n):\n    if cached_djk[start] does not exists:\n        cached_djk[start] = dijkstras(start)\n    \n    djk = cached_djk[start]\n    # reconstructs the path  \n    path = [end] as queue\n    while path.back != start:\n        path.enqueue(djk['predecessors'][path.back])\n    \n    return {\n        'distance': djk['distances'][end],\n        'path': path\n    }\nend function\n```\n\nIn this case, `dijkstras` would need to be modified to return the `distance` and `predecessor` rather than just `distance[end]`.\n\nAfter being implemented in Python, `cached_djk` resembles the following:\n\n```python\ndef fetch_djk(start, end):\n    if start not in cached_djk:\n        cached_djk[start] = dijkstra(start)\n\n    djk = cached_djk[start]\n    # reconstructs the path\n    path = [end]\n    while path[0] != start:\n        path.insert(0, djk['predecessors'][path[0]])\n\n    return {'cost': djk['distances'][end], 'path': path}\n```\n\n##### Update: Caching After Timetable Considerations\n\nThe above pseudocode for `fetch_djk` breaks once considerations of train/bus arrival times are added, because for example, the time it takes to travel from Glen Waverley to Melbourne Central at 7am is not necessarily the same as the same trip at 9pm. Above, the `cached_djk` dictionary only takes the starting node into consideration, so the pseudocode has to be modified to the following to us an 'id' like system for the paths.\n\n```\ncached_djk = dictionary of node -\u003e dict\n\nfunction fetch_djk (\n    start: node,\n    end: node,\n    current_time: datetime,\n):\n\tname = start + '@' + current_time\n\t\n    if cached_djk[name] does not exists:\n        cached_djk[name] = dijkstras(start)\n    \n    djk = cached_djk[name]\n    # reconstructs the path  \n    path = [end] as queue\n    while path.back != start:\n        path.enqueue(djk['predecessors'][path.back])\n    \n    return {\n        'distance': djk['distances'][end],\n        'path': path\n    }\nend function\n```\n\nAs such we can have a more specific key in our dictionary. This does have the disadvantage of having less reusable paths (running at 7 nodes was about 4 times slower than below), but at least the result isn't nondeterministic!\n\n#### Performance Improvement\n\nAs expected by the theoretical time savings calculated above, this optimisation makes Held-Karp roughly 31 times faster. The base case from above, which took 44 - 47 seconds before the optimisation now only takes about 1.25 seconds.\n\n```\nLet's say I have 9 friends, they live closest to the following nodes: {'Parliament', 'Melbourne Central', 'Chadstone', 'Camberwell', 'Flinders Street', 'Brighton Beach', 'Mount Waverley', 'CGS WH', 'Wheelers Hill Library'}\nThe following would be the fastest path to go from my house (Brandon Park) to all my friends' and back:\n{'cost': 262, 'path': ['Brandon Park', 'Wheelers Hill Library', 'CGS WH', 'Glen Waverley', 'Mount Waverley', 'Richmond', 'Camberwell', 'Richmond', 'Parliament', 'Melbourne Central', 'Flinders Street', 'Brighton Beach', 'Flinders Street', 'Caulfield', 'Chadstone', 'Oakleigh', 'Brandon Park']}\n\nIt took 1.2799 seconds to run.\n```\n\nThe $n \\space \\textrm{vs} \\space t$ table now looks like this, with an approximate line of best fit of $y \\approx a \\times b^{x}$ where $a=1.4002\\times10^{-9}$ and $b=10.1876$:\n\n| $n$ (no. nodes) | $t$ (execution time in seconds, 4dp) | $y$ (line of best fit, 4dp) |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 0               | 0.0001                               | 0.0000                      |\n| 1               | 0.0001                               | 0.0000                      |\n| 2               | 0.0001                               | 0.0000                      |\n| 3               | 0.0001                               | 0.0000                      |\n| 4               | 0.0001                               | 0.0000                      |\n| 5               | 0.0005                               | 0.0002                      |\n| 6               | 0.0060                               | 0.0016                      |\n| 7               | 0.0287                               | 0.0159                      |\n| 8               | 0.2148                               | 0.1625                      |\n| 9               | 1.6055                               | 1.6551                      |\n| 10              | 17.4555                              | 16.8620                     |\n| 11              | 171.6719                             | 171.7832                    |\n| 12              | 1750.1065                            | 1750.0590                   |\n\nWe can see that this line of best fit is relatively accurate, and if we extend it to run for 14 nodes (our hamiltonian circuit), it would take a total of about 2 days 2 hours 27 mins and 14 secs to compute it all.\n\n## Justification of Solution\n\nThroughout this report, each individual algorithm has been challenged and justified for it's suitability and effectiveness at solving their individual problems. To evaluate the overall suitability of the combined algorithms, we can refer back to our original problem:\n\n\u003e I've been finding it hard to plan hangouts with my friends, and I want a solution that will plan a trip using the Victorian public transport network so that can find the quickest route to pick up all of my friends and we can all come back to my house.\n\nIn reality, this is a relatively niche use case, as most friends *could* just travel on their own, but given that I want to pick up all my friends along the way, this solution its suitability and fitness for purpose well.\n\nBelow is the output of the solution when I (`Garv`, with a concession card) leave my house at `8:30am` , on a Saturday:\n\n```\nI have 18 friends and they live closest to the following 7 nodes:\nGrace lives 3.317km from Caulfield\nSophie lives 10.094km from Camberwell\nZimo lives 1.046km from CGS WH\nEmma lives 2.317km from Wheelers Hill Library\nSabrina lives 1.036km from CGS WH\nAudrey lives 6.993km from CGS WH\nEric lives 2.592km from Glen Waverley\nIsabella lives 2.048km from CGS WH\nJosh lives 0.657km from CGS WH\nMolly lives 7.56km from Wheelers Hill Library\nAvery lives 6.313km from Mount Waverley\nSammy lives 3.409km from Brandon Park\nNatsuki lives 6.419km from CGS WH\nLiam lives 0.808km from Mount Waverley\nNick lives 1.37km from Glen Waverley\nWill lives 6.405km from Wheelers Hill Library\nBella lives 0.716km from Wheelers Hill Library\nYou (Garv) live 0.432km from Brandon Park\n\nWarning! These 11 friends have to walk more than 20 minutes in order to get to their transport hub. Possibly consider adding hubs closer to their houses:  Grace (39.03), Sophie (118.75), Emma (27.26), Audrey (82.27), Eric (30.49), Isabella (24.1), Molly (88.94), Avery (74.27), Sammy (40.1), Natsuki (75.52) and Will (75.35)\n\nThe trip would cost you $3.35 and would take you 266.17 minutes, taking the following route: \nFrom Brandon Park (Garv, Sammy) to Wheelers Hill Library (Emma, Molly, Will, Bella) to CGS WH (Zimo, Sabrina, Audrey, Isabella, Josh, Natsuki) to Glen Waverley (Eric, Nick) to Mount Waverley (Avery, Liam) to Richmond to Flinders Street to Caulfield (Grace) to Flinders Street to Richmond to Camberwell (Sophie) to Richmond to Oakleigh and back to Brandon Park.\n\nIt took 0.8578 seconds to run.\n```\n\nThe correctness of this being the quickest route was presented as informal arguments via mathematical induction throughout the report, relying on modifications to the Held-Karp Algorithm to model features of the real world scenario and provide us with an answer to our problem. As can be seen above, the solution suitably provides the fastest route, which friends will be picked up at which nodes, the time it would take for the traversal to occur and the overall cost of the trip. This satisfactorily answers the initial problem and is fit for the purpose of planning real life trips that would involve picking up all my friends to visit my house.\n\n## Final Code\n\nThe final Python implementation of the code can be found [here](https://trinket.io/python3/55e1b08d8e) on Trinket. Below is the final main thread in structured pseudocode that invokes all the modules described throughout the report.\n\n```\nfunction main(\n\tfriends: dictionary,\n\tlandmarks: dictionary,\n\troutes: dictionary,\n\ttimetable: dictionary\n):\n\t// global variable declarations\n\tconcession: bool = Ask the user \"Do you posses a concession card?\"\n\tholiday: bool = Ask the user \"Is today a weekend or a holiday?\"\n\tuser_name: string = Ask the user to select a friend from friends dictionary\n\tselected_time = Ask the user what time they are leaving\n\t\n\tcached_djk: dictionary = empty dictionary\n\tedge_lookup_matrix: matrix = |V| x |V| matrix that stores a list of edges in each entry\n\t\n\t// get distance of all friends from landmarks\n\tfriend_distances: dictionary = calculate_nodes(friends, landmarks)\n\tvisit_set: set = set of all closest nodes from friend_distances\n\tpeople_at_nodes: dictionary = all friends sorted into keys of which nodes they are closest to, from visit_set\n\t\n\thome: string = closest node of user_name\n\t\n\tprint all friends, where they live closest to and how far away\n\t\n\tprint out friends that would take more than 20 minutes to walk (average human walking speed is 5.1 km/h)\n\t\n\thamiltonian_path = held_karp(home, home, visit_set, selected_time)\n\t\n\tprint how much the trip would cost and how long it would take\n\t\n\tprint the path of the hamiltonian_path\nend function\n```","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.222319167Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Algorithmics/SAT/Optimisations-saved-for-Unit-4":{"title":"Optimisations (saved for Unit 4)","content":"### Caching Held-Karp's Output\n\nThe same principle as above can be applied to the Held-Karp algorithm. Although it is a harder task to make Held-Karp iterative, the result of computations can be stored rather than calling `held_karp` every time. As above, this can be done with an intermediary function, `fetch_hk` which only runs `held_karp` if the value hasn't already been stored.\n\nThe pseudocode for this process is relatively simple:\n\n```\ncached_hk = dictionary of list -\u003e dict\n\nfunction fetch_hk (\n\tstart: node, \n\tend: node,\n\tvisit: set of nodes \n):\n\tif cached_hk[[start, end, visit]] does not exists:\n\t\tcached_hk[[start, end, visit]] = held_karp(start, end, visit)\n\treturn cached_hk[[start, end, visit]]\nend function\n```\n\nAfter being implemented in Python, `fetch_hk` resembles the following:\n\n```python\ndef fetch_hk(start, end, visit):\n    key = frozenset([start, end, frozenset(visit)])\n    if key not in cached_hk:\n        cached_hk[key] = held_karp(start, end, visit)\n    return cached_hk[key]\n```\n\n#### Performance Improvement\n\nThough this is a somewhat minor change, the improvements are drastic, with the entire hamiltonian circuit being calculated in less than a second. The $n \\space \\textrm{vs} \\space t$ table now looks like this, with an approximate line of best fit of $y \\approx a \\times b^{x}$ where $a=0.00000544325$ and $b=2.36503$:\n\n| $n$ (no. nodes) | $t$ (execution time in seconds, 4dp) | $y$ (line of best fit, 4dp) |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 0               | 0.0001                               | 0.0000                      |\n| 1               | 0.0001                               | 0.0000                      |\n| 2               | 0.0001                               | 0.0000                      |\n| 3               | 0.0001                               | 0.0001                      |\n| 4               | 0.0001                               | 0.0002                      |\n| 5               | 0.0002                               | 0.0004                      |\n| 6               | 0.0005                               | 0.0010                      |\n| 7               | 0.0012                               | 0.0023                      |\n| 8               | 0.0030                               | 0.0053                      |\n| 9               | 0.0081                               | 0.0126                      |\n| 10              | 0.0210                               | 0.0298                      |\n| 11              | 0.0520                               | 0.0705                      |\n| 12              | 0.2051                               | 0.1667                      |\n| 13              | 0.5061                               | 0.3942                      |\n| 14              | 0.8246                               | 0.9323                      |\n| 15              | 2.2284                               | 2.2050                      |\n\nEvidently this is significantly better, with Held-Karp at 12 nodes being about 8,533 times faster than without this optimisation. Across a couple tests, the $b$ value of the line of best fit seems to hover around $2.1-2.3$, which indicates that we're nearing the limits of our optimisations. The theoretical average time complexity of Held-Karp is $O(2^{n}n^{2})$, and it is unknown if any algorithm exists to solve TSP in a time complexity of less than base 2. As such, the closer we get to base 2, the more \"perfectly\" we have optimised our algorithm, and as of now we're pretty close.\n\n// this is saved code to be put back in later (optimisation)\n```python\n    cached_djk = {}\n    cached_hk = {}\n    \ndef fetch_djk(start, end):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm.\n\n    :param start: start node\n    :type start: str\n\n    :param end: end node\n    :type end: str\n\n    :return: The shortest distance between two nodes along with the path.\n    :rtype: dict[str, float | list[str]]\n    \"\"\"\n\n    global cached_djk\n    if start not in cached_djk:\n        cached_djk[start] = dijkstra(start)\n\n    djk = cached_djk[start]\n    # reconstructs the path\n    path = [end]\n    while path[0] != start:\n        path.insert(0, djk['predecessors'][path[0]])\n\n    return {'cost': djk['distances'][end], 'path': path}\n\ndef fetch_hk(start, end, visit):\n    key = frozenset([start, end, frozenset(visit)])\n    if key not in cached_hk:\n        cached_hk[key] = held_karp(start, end, visit)\n    return cached_hk[key]\n    \ndef dijkstra(start):\n    \"\"\"\n    Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm.\n\n    :param start: start node\n    :type start: str\n\n    :return: The distance dictionary and the predecessor dictionary.\n    :rtype: dict\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # set all nodes to infinity with no predecessor\n    distance = {node: float('inf') for node in g.nodes()}\n    predecessor = {node: None for node in g.nodes()}\n    unexplored = list(g.nodes())\n\n    distance[start] = 0\n\n    while len(unexplored) \u003e 0:\n        min_node = min(unexplored, key=lambda node: distance[node])\n        unexplored.remove(min_node)\n\n        for neighbour in g.neighbors(min_node):\n            current_dist = distance[min_node] + dist(min_node, neighbour)\n            # a shorter path has been found to the neighbour ∴ relax value\n            if current_dist \u003c distance[neighbour]:\n                distance[neighbour] = current_dist\n                predecessor[neighbour] = min_node\n\n    return {'distances': distance, 'predecessors': predecessor}\n```\n\n```\npandoc \"Garv's SAT- Friendship Network.md\" -o \"Garv's SAT- Friendship Network.pdf\" --from markdown --toc --listings -H setup.tex\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.226319344Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Algorithmics/Time-Complexity":{"title":"Time Complexity","content":"Dictionaries are O(1) time","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.226319344Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Algorithmics/Weeks/Unit-3/Week-1/Goat-Cabbage-Wolf-Hunter":{"title":"Goat Cabbage Wolf Hunter","content":"\n\u003e [!info]\n\u003e \n\u003e You have 4n counters of 4 types: n wolves, n goats, n cabbages, and n hunters.

I see \\[ənʌdə sneɪjəw]\"\n\n**Morphological \u0026 Syntactic Perspective**\n- We can clearly see Bella well into stage as she is beginning to add grammatical morphemes to speech: \n\t- \"\\[dɛəz] Mickey\" uses contraction for \"there is\"\n\t- \"Look he \\[pʊdɪn] his head way up in sky\": still developing inflectional morpheme -ing, g-dropping: replacing /ŋ/ sound with /n/, putting -\u003e puttin'\n\n- That last utterance was outlier, MLU is approx 3.44 lexemes, while this utterance had 9 lexemes, much higher than mean\n- This is a common phrase, almost a collocation, possibly replacing the word sky with \"clouds\" or \"stars\". \n- Common phrase could have been repeated by MKO such as parents or grandmother and imitated by Bella, supporting Skinner's Behaviourist ideas\n\nNonetheless, clear that Bella well into telegraphic stage, with good syntactic knowledge and understanding of location, and addition of the contractive \"is\" and gerund  as part of speech. \nBeing said, still does not use many conjunctions or why questions, place approximately 5 months ahead of expected language development.\n\n### Supported Theories\naka Carer Strategies\n- Mainly supports behaviourism + interactionism, evidently learning through interaction with MKO\n- Lines that support cognitivism are present\n\t- Displays a proper understanding of location:\n\t\t- G: \"Do you see another one?\"\n\t\t- C: \"\\[ʌn də flaʊwə]\"\n\t- She would not be able to talk about location of snail if she didn't understand location as concept, so cognitivism is supported in this way\n\t\t- G: \"Do you see another snail?\"\n\t\t- C: \"\\[ən dæ twiː]\"\n\t- Bella has also begun to use simple prepositions, such as \"on\" or \"in\"\n- Not much evidence of innateness ∵ lack of “virtuous errors”, active role played by Grandma\n\n- Throughout transcription, Child-directed-speech has constant repetition of phrases more \"correctly\" by MKO, evidence of operant conditioning and scaffolding.\n\t- eg. \"Look! I see \\[ənʌdə sneɪjəw]\", Grandma replied back, \"Do you see another snail?\"\n\t- Repetition of more correct utterance supports the idea that Bella will imitate, -\u003e negative reinforcement, supports behaviourist ideas\n\t- The transition of the declarative sentence to the interrogative sentence shows how MKO is scaffolding for child, expanding ZPD by questioning -\u003e interactionist ideas supported\n#### Interactionism\nTheory emphasises the interaction between children and their caregivers, in this case Bella \u0026 Grandma\nFocuses a lot on ZPD and scaffolded needed for learning to develop\n- G: \"Yes he's in the tree\" later Bella says \"Look he \\[pʊdɪn]\"\n- Strongly supports interactionist theory: Bella no way of knowing the snail is male, but bc Grandma automatically assumes gender, Bella learns to assume the same. As such, Bella learns about society's perceptions of the world\n#### Behaviourism\n- Supported by various examples of recasts throughout transcript, uses operant conditioning for negative reinforcement\n- Prime example is\n\t- C: \"Where \\[nʌdə sneɪjəl]\"\n\t- G: \"Where's another snail\"\n- Later in exact same passage, Bella is seen correcting herself by imitating her Grandma, repeating the exact same recast in a more phonetically correct lexeme \"another\" (not ellided)\n\t- G: \"There's another snail\"\n\t- C: \"\\[dɛəz ənʌdə sneɪjəw]\"\n- This recast also supports interactionism, as it provides scaffolding to build on ZPD\n\n## The Subsystems\n\n### Phonological Processes\nMany phonological processes taking place in Bella's language, and though she's mostly intelligible, clear that her phonetic ability is at that of telegraphic stage\n- “\\[kaɪm] on \\[tiː] a \\[sneɪjəl], see”\n\t- Elision of the /l/ and /ɹ/ consonant clusters -\u003e cluster reduction\n\t- Epenthesis of the /jə/ sound\n- \"\\[dɛəz ənʌdə sneɪjəw]\"\n\t- Can see that epenthesis of /jə/ sound is consistent across her speech\n\t- /l/ consonant cluster also struggles her with an example of gliding the /l/ to /w/\n- \"Where \\[nʌdə sneɪjəl]\"\n\t- Can see all examples so far had consistent th-stops turning /ð/ -\u003e /d/, has a lot of gliding but mostly intelligible, indication of child-like speech\n\t- also elides /ə/ sound sometimes, especially when at start of word, but corrected by imitation and operant conditioning\nConsistent th-stopping makes sense of age group, as children not expected to properly articulate /ð/ until 4 - 6 years of age.\nBecause /ð/ sound is quite complex, have to remember to breathe out with tiny gap between teeth and tongue. If this gap is forgotten /d/ is produced instead. Evidently sounds are very close in mouth, and subtle differences not picked up this early, especially at less than 2 years old.\n\n### Lexicology\n\u003e in ppt make sure to add couple transcribed examples\n\nBella's demonstrated lexicon is about 20 words give or take, repeating \"there's\", \"another\", \"snail\", and \"where\" quite a bit. \nThe repetition of phrases not unexpected at this development stage. Phrase \"look he puttin' his head way up in sky\" from before was well beyond demonstrated lexicon of Bella's throughout convo, further show outlier.\n- Grandma and Bella probably spend quite bit of time in garden, as most content words she knows are under the semantic field of nature, such as \"climb, tree, snail\"\n- Also knows words for people she spends lot of time with, such as brother \"Mickey\", supporting interactionist ideas that interaction with MKO reinforces language learning\nNew words are introduced through questioning and scaffolding, once again supporting interactionism\n- G: \"What colour is that flower?\"\n- C: \"Look! I see \\[ənʌdə sneɪjəw]\"\n- Bella is distracted, and does not answer the question, but is still prompted to use new lexemes to describe her environment\n\n### Morphology\nAs noted before, Bella is able to utilise the gerund, meaning she can use the inflectional morpheme -ing. \n- Contrapuntally, she does not appear to use the -s morpheme to indicate the plural of snail, showing that her morphological progress is in the early phase of the telegraphic stage\nBella also shows evidence of articles such as \"a\" appearing, showing that she is beginning to use more articles and function words in her speech:\n- G: Look here's a snail\n- C: \"\\[hiːəz ə sneɪjəl]\"\nAlso very clear evidence of a recast, imitating what MKO is saying and learning to add more grammar to speech.\nOverall, Bella's morphological ability is at expected stage for a two year old, where utterances have a clear hierarchical structure but is not yet that of adult grammar. \n\n### Syntax/Semantics\n- Both syntax and semantics of Bella's speech have been explored previously in presentation\n- To reiterate, errors are dealt with by caregiver in a very behaviourist fashion, by recasting or repeating the utterance in a more correct form\n- Semantically, is able to use interrogative sentences to question the world around her, using many \"where\" questions\n- Still does not use any compound sentences yet, but SVO structure is present, showing it's developing\n\t- \"I see \\[ənʌdə sneɪjəw]\"\n\t- Subject \"I\", Verb \"see\", Object \"another snail\"\n\n### Discourse\nFinally, Bella is picking up discourse features well.\nAdjacency pairs:\n- G: \"You want me to climb in the tree?\"\n- C: \"\\[jɑː]\"\n- G: \"No way, silly monkey! You want to climb in the tree?\"\n- C: \"\\[jɑː]\"\nThese adjacency pairs show that Bella is just saying yes to question without necessarily knowing the meaning, but she understands that it is a question.\n\nBella also mostly coherent, participating in turn taking structure as seen above. Bella also sometimes uses discourse markers in her speech:\n- C: \"oh, oh!\"\nThis interjection of surprise conveys meaning to excitement, conveying meaning to MKO.\n\n**Caretaker**\nCaretaker uses confirmation requests to prompt and scaffold the child.\n- G: \"That's a lot of snails, isn't it?\"\n- or G: \"You put the snail in the garden, did you?\"\nScaffolding once again supports interactionist theories, as the discourse between the child and caregiver driving the conversation teaches Bella language.\n\n## Conclusion\n- Overall, Bella is quite relatively for her age. She seems to be well into the telegraphic stage of her language development, about 5 months ahead of the expected development at her age.\n- This is evident by the emerging subsystems evident in her speech, such as the ability to ask questions and use prepositions of location.\n- Throughout the passage, the grandma acts as a MKO and uses development strategies that very closely align with the Behaviourist and Interactionist language acquisition theories.\n- Bella will likely continue to refine her language use as she approaches more adult-like grammatical ability, adding more function words and morphemes into her speech. \n\t- She already shows evidence of this, such as the inklings of using the inflectional gerund and basic article usage, but will develop more\n\n- Like to finish off with a quote\n\u003e “In sum, then, \"thinking about thinking\" has to be a principal ingredient of any empowering practice of education.”\n\nThank you for listening!\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.270321291Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/Child-Language-Acquisition/Theories":{"title":"Theories","content":"#englang #cla \n\n## Behaviourist - Skinner #card\nChildren imitate adults. Their correct utterances are reinforced when they get what they want or are praised.\n^1683502539271\n\nB.F. Skinner is the main theorist associated with the language learning theory. He states that language learning involves \"input, imitation, and habit formation through repetition\". This conclusion was reached.\n\nAll children are born as a \"blank slate\", and all learning happens through a process called operant conditioning. A child can be trained to repeat certain actions if they get a favourable response (positive reinforcement) or a lack of any positive response that will discourage repetition in the future (negative enforcement).\n\nRole of caregiver: models language for the child to copy and provides positive reinforcement for success.\nLexical development: copies lexemes as heard\nSyntactic development: children learn key phrases and then substitute key words\n\"Monkey hear, monkey say!\"\n\n### Limitations #card\n- Children rarely simply repeat what adults say\n- Children often make 'virtuous errors' - logical but non-standard utterances, which suggest they are creatively working out grammatical rules, not copying\n- Children appear to go through the same predictable stages of development whatever the input. This throws into question the importance of positive and negative reinforcement from adults.\n^1683502539277\n\n## Innateness/Nativism - Chomsky #card\nA child's brain contains special language-learning mechanisms at birth.\n^1683502539281\n\nArgued that the human brain has a naturally programmed ability to learn language and an ability to work out language systems in terms of grammar and syntax.\nThe term *universal grammar* is also used to describe this global capacity to learn languages at similar rates and in similar ways.\nThe idea of virtuous errors helps support the idea of the LAD.\n\nNutshell: Language Acquisition Device (LAD) is programmed to acquire language, all children have inbuilt ability to learn language\nRole of caregiver: do not activity shape or train children in their language\nLexical development: the brain knows the words go onto categories and fits them once exposed\nSyntactic development: LAD processes the categories of words and how these categories interact within syntax to place words in sentences\n\"I was born to talk!\"\n\n### Limitations\nIt has been argued that a child is born not with a set of linguistic categories but with some sort of process mechanism - a set of procedures and inference rules.\nThe work was also purely theoretical, not based on linguistic data.\nThe theory also seems to downplay the part played by interaction between the children and their carers.\n\n## Cognitive - Piaget #card\nLanguage is just one aspect of a child's overall intellectual development.\n^1683502539286\n\nThis suggests that children would not develop until particular stages of cognitive development had been reached.\nOutlines four cognitive stages: Sensorimotor (0 - 2) years, Pre-operational (2-6/7 years), Concrete operational (6/7-11/12 years) and Formal operational (11-16+ years).\n\nFor example, a child would not be able to use comparative adjectives (small, smaller, smallest, etc) unless they first understood the concept of size.\nIt's possible to link a child's language to their conception development in early stages, such as object permanence which enables the child to articulate abstract ideas and talk about non-deictical concepts.\n\n## Interaction - Bruner #card\nThis theory emphasises the interaction between children and their caregivers.\n^1683502539291\n\nRejects the LAD and focuses on the importance of a child's interaction with caregivers as the key to language development.\nSuggested the importance of a Language Acquisition Support System (LASS) which refers to the caregivers and other important participants within a child's life.\nSuggested that the way in which carers question, encourage and support the child through scaffolding (like fill in the gaps, basically helping/structure) enables children to gradually develop their speech.\nConcentrated more on the need for quality input from caregivers to facilitate learning rather than on imitation and positive/negative reinforcement. \n\n### Scaffolding\nLev Vygotsky suggested the importance of *doing* for a child to be able to develop, and suggested that a parent acts as a \"more knowledgable other\" (MKO), and this helps develop the ZPD\n\n### Limitations\nAll children of all backgrounds and languages tend to progress through similar stages predictably, so this challenges the idea that children exposed to child-directed speech will tend to develop more quickly.\nSome cultures (e.g. the Kaluli tribe in Papua New Guinea) dont appear to use child-directed speech at all to young children - yet youngsters' language seems to develop at the same rate as elsewhere.\n\n\n## Additional Theories\n### Critical Period/Age Hypothesis - Eric Lenneberg  #card\nCoined the term critical period\nBelieved that in the first few years of life, sufficient social interaction and exposure to language was essential in order that a child might gain fill master of the language.\nThis links in well to the case of Genie, as after she had passed the critical period, she was not able to acquire language beyond a very basic level.\n^1683502539300\n\n### The Wug Test - Jean Berko Gleason #card\nCreated in 1985 to test the notion that children have a more sophisticated understanding of linguistic morphology than they have been taught explicitly.\nUses pseudo words like 'wug' to ensure the child has never been exposed to the word previously.\n76% of 4 to 5 years old were able to deduce what the plural of the noun 'wug' would be.\nThe results seem to suggest that children have an ability to understand grammatical rules (in this case, grammatical inflections) and *transfer* them to other examples they've never heard before. This supports Chomsky's nativist theory.\n^1683502539306\n\n## Acquisition-Learning Hypothesis #card \nThis hypothesis states that there is a difference between language learning and language acquisition\n- The learner acquires language unconsciously in language acquisition\n\t- The main criteria is the provision of \"**comprehensible input**\" which provide input just above the learner's existing level of competency - Krashan coined this as 'input+1' or 'i+1'\n- In language learning (explicitly taught), the learner picks up the language through conscious discovery and by learning the grammatical rules and structures of the language\n^1685778018373\n\n## Monitor Hypothesis #card \nAccording to the monitor hypothesis, the learner learns the grammar rules and functions of the language consciously (thinks about them and check themselves after an utterance) rather than its meaning\n- It lays more emphasis on the correctness of the language\nThere are three standards required to use this hypothesis properly:\n- The acquirer must know the language rules\n- The acquirer must reproduce the exact form of the language\n- The acquirer must review the language and apply its rules in a conversation\n^1685778018381\n\n## Natural Order Hypothesis #card \nThe natural order hypothesis is the idea that children learning their first language acquire grammatical structures in a pre-determined, 'natural' order, and that some are acquired earlier than others.\nAccording to the natural order hypothesis, learners acquire the grammatical morpheme-ing before the morpheme third person -s\nOne possible implication of this hypothesis is that teaching language through a traditional structural syllabus may not necessarily help them to acquire the language they need.\nAttempts to get the learners to produce structures before they are ready to do so may fail.\n^1685778018385\n\n## Input Hypothesis #card \nThis hypothesis focuses on acquisition rather than learning of the second language. It suggests that the learner develops the language naturally as they receive fun and interesting information.\nAcquisition theories emphasis the importance of comprehensible input, which is language just beyond the competence of the learner and provides the ideal conditions for acquisition to happen.\n^1685778018388\n\nIn the classroom:\n\n## Affective Filter Hypothesis #card \nThis hypothesis that emotional factors can affect language acquisition. They can have a negative or positive effect.\nNegative affective factors are called affective filters and are an important idea in theories about second language acquisition. The learner is less likely to learn the language if the affective filter is higher.\nHence, the learning environment must be stress-fee and positive so that the learner can learn properly.\n^1685778018389\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.270321291Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/English-Language":{"title":"English Language","content":"#englang #subject\n\n## Unit 1\n- ### Transition Program\n\t- Read about Helen Thompson's [[The Eloquent Ape]]\n\t- Find two [[Interesting English Language Articles]] and share them with the class\n\t- Write a short 4 - 500 word essay on why \"[[Freedom of Speech Essay|Freedom of speech gives people the right to use hate speech]]\"\n- Week 1:\n\t- [[What is a Language?]]\n\t- [[Variables of Communication]]\n\t- [[Features of Language]]\n- Week 2: lol, skipped\n- Week 3:\n\t- [[Phonetics \u0026 Phonology]]\n- Week 4 \u0026 5:\n\t- [[Morphology \u0026 Lexicology]]\n- Week 6: \n\t- [[Syntax]]\n\t- [[Key Terms]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.270321291Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/Language-Change/Prestige-and-Language":{"title":"Prestige and Language","content":"\nReceived Pronunciation:: the accent needed to be received in court, very much like the queen's English\n\nOvert prestige:: language that is openly prestigious, such as the English accent or the cultivated Australian accent\n\nCovert prestige:: language because it is \"cool\", such as the language of hip hop and how it is trendy.

An example would be \"un-\"\n^1678180906342\n\nCan further be divided into 4 categories:\n- Prefix: *un*-happy\n- Suffix happi-*ness*\n- Infix: abso-*blooming*-lutely (only non-standard words in English)\n- Circumfix: *en*-light-*en*, same meaning of affixes ∴ em-bold-en would have be an example of a circumfix\n  \n### Derivational vs Inflectional Morphemes\n#### Derivational Morphemes #card\n**Derivational morphemes** create or derive new words by changing the meaning or changing the word class of the word. For example, happy turns into unhappy, and both words are adjectives but the meaning changes.\n^1678180906349\n\n##### The Diminutive Suffix #card\nA diminutive creates a meaning of ‘small’ or ‘little’ (this can be literal or notional) The most common diminutives are formed with and with suffixes such as _-let_ and _-y_. We often use a diminutive with names or with abbreviated names when we want to be more informal, or to express affection for someone or something.\n- _Here’s a book**let** which gives advice on keep-fit._ (_booklet_ = a small book)\n- _Right, Matt**y**, I’ve got some very good news for you._ (_Matty_ is formed from the name ‘Matthew’)\n- _I think she’s the perfect kitt**y** for Jennifer._ (_kitty_ is formed from ‘kitten’ a young cat)\n- What a cute little duck**ling**\n^1683501679006\n\n#### Inflectional Morphemes #card \n**Inflectional morphemes** don't alter the meaning or word class of a word; instead they only refine and give extra grammatical information about the word's already existing meaning. For example cat into cats or walk into walking.\n^1678180906352\n\nIn English, all inflectional morphemes are suffixes (only by chance, since in other languages this is not true) and there are 8 of them.\n- -s, 3rd person sg. present\n  \"He waits\"\n- -ed, past tense (also -t as in \"used to\" or \"spent\")\n  \"He waited\"\n- -ing, progressive\n  \"He is waiting\"\n- -en, past participle\n  \"I had eaten\"\n- -s, plural\n  \"Both chairs are broken\"\n- -'s, possessive\n  \"The chair's leg is broken\"\n- -er, comparative, can also be agentive but that's derivational\n  \"He was faster\"\n- -est, superlative\n  \"He was the fastest\"\n\n## Word Formations\n### Affixation #card\nForming new words by adding an extra bound morpheme, so an affix.\n^1683501679018\n\n### Compounding #card\nForming new words not from bound affixes but from two or more independent words: the words can be free morphemes, words derived by affixation, or even words formed by compounds themselves. e.g. girlfriend, blackbird\n^1683501679021\n\nBy putting stress on both words you seperate them into two words\n\n### Reduplication #card\nThis is forming new words either by doubling an entire free morpheme (total reduplication) or part of a morpheme (partial reduplication).\n^1683501679026\n\n### Blending #card\nWhere two words are merged together, such as:\n- brunch - from breakfast and lunch\n- smog - from smoke and fog\n- spork - from spoon and fork\n^1683501679031\n\n## The Parts of Speech\nA part of speech is a class of words based on the word's function, the way it works in a sentence. They are sometime's referred to as word classes.\n\n### Nouns #card\n'Noun' is the name given to words that name things or concepts.\nThere are many different types, or sub classes of nouns, some you will be familiar with, other maybe not.\n^1677146895726\n\n### Verbs #card\nVerbs are words that describe what a subject is doing. They also describe relationships between one thing and another, allowing us to place an event, state, etc. in the past, present or future. \n^1677146895729\n\n### Adjective #card\nA word that modifies or defines a noun, or a describing word. \n##### Degrees of Adjectives\n- Positive Degree: plain old adjective, e.g. happy\n- Comparative Degree: e.g. happier\n- Superlative Degree: e.g. happiest\n- Absolute: e.g. unique\n^1677146895731\n\n### Adverbs #card\nAdverbs are words that change, modify or qualify a verb, or another adjective/adverb. \n^1677146895733\n\n### Pronouns #card\nPronouns are words which we use in place of a noun, to avoid being repetitive.\nThe noun they replace is known as the antecedent. The antecedent doesn't always come before the pronoun that replaces it.\n^1677146895735\n\nSaying \"John did ....... He .......\" is **anaphoric reference**, whereas if the pronoun was before it would be **cataphoric reference**. \n\n### Prepositions #card\nAs the name suggests, a preposition places, links or connects words and phrases to other words and phrases within a sentence. Prepositions usually come directly before a noun in a sentence and can also precede a gerund verb (non-finite form, -ing version where it's being used as a noun \"shopping really annoys me\").\n^1677146895738\n\n### Conjunctions #card\nConjunctions connect words, phrases, clauses and sentences. They tell us the relationship between 'thoughts'.\n^1677146895740\n\n### Interjection #card\nAn interjection is a word or expression that occurs as an utterance on its own and expresses a spontaneous feeling or reaction.\nThe category is quite heterogeneous, and includes such things such as exclamations, curses, greetings, response particles, and hesitation markers.\n^1677146895742\n\n## Types of Writing Systems\n### Orthographic #card\nThis type of writing system is arbitrary and the language is \"represented\" in writing by something like an alphabet, such as English.\n^1677545865722\n\n### Iconographic #card\nThis type of writing system is less arbitrary and uses icons that visually represent what they're meant to mean, such as Chinese or Korean.\n^1677545865723\n\n## Accent and Dialect #card\nAccent is to do with how things are pronounced, purely to do with sound, while dialect is to do with words and the lexicon that people pull from.

British **Sandwicher** for \"a Hawaiian\"). The family name is from the place in Kent, one of the Cinque Ports, Old English Sandwicæ, literally \"sandy harbor (or trading center).\"\n\n- **Berserk (adj.):**\n  1844, from berserk (n.) \"Norse warrior\" (by 1835), an alternative form of [berserker](https://www.etymonline.com/word/berserker?ref=etymonline_crossreference \"Etymology, meaning and definition of berserker\"), a word which was introduced (as berserkar) by Sir Walter Scott in \"The Pirate\" (1822), from Old Norse berserkr (n.) \"raging warrior of superhuman strength.\" It is probably from *ber- \"bear\" + serkr \"shirt,\" thus literally \"a warrior clothed in bearskin\" (see [[n.]]%20+%C2%A0%5Bsark%5D(https://www.etymonline.com/word/sark?ref=etymonline_crossreference%20%22Etymology,%20meaning%20and%20definition%20of%20sark%22%7C%5Bhttps://www.etymonline.com/word/bear?ref=etymonline_crossreference#etymonline_v_8204%20%22Etymology,%20meaning%20and%20definition%20of%20bear%22)). Thus not, as Scott evidently believed, from Old Norse berr \"bare, naked\" and meaning \"warrior who fights without armor.\"\n\n- **Nightmare (n.):**\n  c. 1300, \"an evil female spirit afflicting men (or horses) in their sleep with a feeling of suffocation,\" compounded from [night](https://www.etymonline.com/word/night?ref=etymonline_crossreference \"Etymology, meaning and definition of night\") + [[https://www.etymonline.com/word/mare?ref=etymonline_crossreference#etymonline_v_43707 \"Etymology, meaning and definition of mare\"]] (n.3) \"goblin that causes nightmares, incubus.\" The meaning shifted mid-16c. from the incubus to the suffocating sensation it causes. Sense of \"any bad dream\" is recorded by 1829; that of \"very distressing experience\" is from 1831.\n\n- **Quarantine (n.):**\n  1660s, \"period a ship suspected of carrying contagious disease is kept in isolation,\" from Italian quaranta giorni, literally \"space of forty days,\" from quaranta \"forty,\" from Latin quadraginta\"forty\" (related to quattuor \"four,\" from PIE root [\\*kwetwer-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*kwetwer-?ref=etymonline_crossreference \"Etymology, meaning and definition of *kwetwer-\") \"four\").\n  \n  The name is from the Venetian policy (first enforced in 1377) of keeping ships from plague-stricken countries waiting off its port for 40 days to assure that no latent cases were aboard. The extended sense of \"any period of forced isolation\" is from 1670s.\n\n- **Clue (n.):**\n  \"anything that guides or directs in an intricate case,\" 1590s, a special use of a revised spelling of [clew](https://www.etymonline.com/word/clew?ref=etymonline_crossreference \"Etymology, meaning and definition of clew\") \"a ball of thread or yarn\" (q.v.). The word, which is native Germanic, in Middle English was clewe, also cleue; some words borrowed from Old French in -ue, -eu also were spelled -ew in Middle English, such as blew, imbew, but these later were reformed to -ue, and this process was extended to native words (hue, true, clue) which had ended in a vowel and -w. The spelling clue is first attested mid-15c.\n  \n  The sense shift is originally in reference to the clew of thread given by Ariadne to Theseus to use as a guide out of the Labyrinth in Greek mythology. The purely figurative sense of \"that which points the way,\" without regard to labyrinths, is from 1620s. As something which a bewildered person does not have, by 1948.\n\n- **Euphemism (n.):**\n  1650s, from Greek euphemismos \"use of a favorable word in place of an inauspicious one, superstitious avoidance of words of ill-omen during religious ceremonies,\" also of substitutions such as [Eumenides](https://www.etymonline.com/word/Eumenides?ref=etymonline_crossreference \"Etymology, meaning and definition of Eumenides\") for the Furies. This is from euphemizein \"speak with fair words, use words of good omen,\" from eu- \"good, well\" (see [eu-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/eu-?ref=etymonline_crossreference \"Etymology, meaning and definition of eu-\")) + phēmē \"speech, voice, utterance, a speaking,\" from phanai \"speak\" (from PIE root [[2]]%20%22to%20speak,%20tell,%20say%22).%20See%20also%C2%A0%5BEuxine%5D(https://www.etymonline.com/word/Euxine?ref=etymonline_crossreference%20%22Etymology,%20meaning%20and%20definition%20of%20Euxine%22%7C%5Bhttps://www.etymonline.com/word/*bha-?ref=etymonline_crossreference#etymonline_v_52548%20%22Etymology,%20meaning%20and%20definition%20of%20*bha-%22), and compare Greek Greek aristeros \"the better one,\" a euphemism for \"the left (hand).\" In English, a rhetorical term at first; broader sense of \"choosing a less distasteful word or phrase than the one meant\" is first attested 1793.\n\n- **Emergency (n.):**\n  \"unforeseen occurrence requiring immediate attention,\" 1630s, from Latin emergens, present participle of emergere \"to rise out or up\" (see [emerge](https://www.etymonline.com/word/emerge?ref=etymonline_crossreference \"Etymology, meaning and definition of emerge\")).

Phonetic transcription focuses on the precise way in which a sound is produced by a particular speaker on a particular occasion, but is not related to any particular language.\n\n\n- We refer to individual sounds as phones or sounds, never letters\n- There are two kinds of transcriptions using the IPA; broad and narrow\n- All broad (general or phonemic) transcriptions is done with phonetic slashes /si/\n- All narrow (phonetic) transcription is done within phonetic brackets:  \\[si]\n\n\u003e Questions:\n\nWhat is phonetics the study of? :: Phonetics is the study of human speech sounds, how they're produced, transmitted and received. ^1677146865711\n\nWhat are the two kinds of transcriptions using the IPA? :: There are two kinds of transcriptions using the IPA; broad and narrow. ^1677146865717\n\n### Fields #card\n#### Articulatory Phonetics\nHow sounds are produced\n#### Acoustic Phonetics\nPhysical properties of sounds\n#### Auditory Phonetics\nHow sounds are perceived\n^1685778115231\n\n### Transcription\nTranscription aims to create a system of one-to-one sound-symbol correspondence, which is not necessarily the case with spelling.\n\nExamples of transcription:\n- Next: /nɛkst/\n- Chin: /tʃɪn/⁠ \n- Lamb: /læm/ \n- Kite: /kaɪt/\n- Cat: /kæt/\n- Meet: /miːt/\n\nA rough-coated, dough-faced, thoughtful ploughman strode through the streets of Scarborough.  After falling into a slough, coughed and hiccoughed.\n\n/ə ɹuf-kəʊted, dəʊ-feɪsd, θɔːtfʊl plaʊmɘn strɵʊd θruː ðə striːts ɒf skɑːbrə. ɑːftə fɔːlɪŋ ɪntuː ə slaʊ, kɑft and hɪkʌpt/\n\n### The International Phonetic Alphabet\nThe IPA is an international alphabet that can transcribe any of the world's languages.\n- In IPA transcription, one phone (IPA symbol) usually equals one sounds\n\n### Allophones #card\nWhat is an allophone? :: Allophones are more specific interpretations of a phoneme, made for narrow transcriptions.  ^1677146865719\n![[Allophone Diagram.png]]\n\n### Place + Manner\n#### **Place** of Articulation #card\n**Where** the sound is made\n![[Human Mouth Diagram.png]]\n##### Consonants\n![[Consonant IPA Table.png]]\nThe top is the place and the and the left is the manner\n##### Vowels\n![[Vowel IPA Table.png]]\n#### **Manner** of Articulation\n**How** the sound is made\n^1685778115248\n\n## Phonology #card\nPhonology is the study of the sound system of a specific language. The sounds of the English language for instance are very different to the sounds of Italian or Mandarin, and the sounds of Australian English differ from those of American English.\n- How many sounds in Australian English? :: 44 phonemes ^1677146865721\n- Each language has different sounds and stresses particular phonemes, and can completely change the meaning of the word (*pro*ject vs pro*ject*)\n\n### Connected Speech\nThere are no actual gaps in between words in speech generally, only written. \n#### Elision #card\nWhat is elision? :: The omission (deletion) of a sound in connected speech (**sounds are lost**) - this sound may be a vowel, a consonant or even a whole syllable. For instance 'cos instead of pronouncing because. We often **elide** sounds in rapid, everyday speech purely for ease of pronunciation. Another example would be 'want to' vs wanna ^1677146865722\n#### Vowel Reduction #card\nWhat is vowel reduction? :: Similar to elision but, instead of disappearing completely, vowels in unstressed positions are reduced to schwa /ə/. So the word 'to' /tu/ might be reduced to /tə/ ^1677146865723\n#### Assimilation #card\nWhat is assimilation? :: When a **sound changes** to become more like a neighbouring sound. Assimilation may be *progressive* where the sound is affected by a preceding sounds, or *regressive* (also known as *anticipatory assimilation*), where the following sound is affected by a following sound.  ^1677146865724\n##### Examples\nProgressive:\n- talked becomes /tɔːkt/\n- pens become /penz/\nRegressive:\n- light blue /laip bluː/\n- green boat becomes /griːm bəʊt/\n\n#### Insertion #card\nWhat is insertion? :: There are two examples of **sounds being added**, generally deliberately. The first is insertion, the other is epenthesis. **Insertion doesn't add a full syllable, whereas epenthesis does**  ^1685778838440\n- a voiceless stop insertion where, between a nasal consonant and a voiceless fricative, a voiceless stop with the same place of articulation as the nasal consonant is inserted.\n\t- e.g. In English, many add a /p/ to hamster and say \"hampster\"/\n- after a nasal consonant, a voiceless stop may be 'added\n\t- e.g. In English, many add a /k/ to something which becomes /sʌmθɪŋk/\n^1677146865725\n\n##### Epenthesis #card\nWhat is epenthesis? :: Epenthesis is the insertion of an extra sound into a word. **Epenthesis adds a full extra syllable** ^1685778838445\n- Involves the addition of sounds (syllables) where they don't strictly belong. For instance, it's common for people to insert a vowel in 'souvlaki' so that it sounds like 'souv-e-laki'. And humbling sometimes becomes humb-e-ling.\n^1677146865726\n\n##### Intrusion #card\nWhat is intrusion? :: This is where sounds are added between words but is not deliberate, but may be put together as insertion.  ^1685778838448\nWhen two vowel sounds meet, we tend to insert an extra sound which resembles wither a /j/, /w/ or /r/, to mark the transition sound between the two vowels, a device referred to as intrusion.\n- Consonants can also be added, for instance Australians often add r in law and order so that it sounds more like \"lor an order\".\n^1677146865728\n\n#### Metathesis #card\nWhat is metathesis? :: Metathesis sounds complicated but it's a very common aspect of the English language. It is the transposition within a word of its sounds. The word \"metathesis\" comes from the Greek word meaning to transpose. It's also known as a permutation.  ^1685778838451\n- Ask becomes /arks/\n- Nuclear becomes /nucələer/\n^1677146865729\n\n### Prosodic Features #card\nAffect **how** we say something\n- Volume is the modulation of volume in your voice, which is used to convey emotions\n- Tempo is the speed and which we speak, reasons for speaking faster or slower\n- Intonation is the pattern of pitch changes in speech, it is the variation of spoken pitch used in language. It can be used to\n\t- Indicate the different attitudes and emotions of the speaker\n\t- Signal the difference between statements, questions.\n- Stress is the degree of strength used to pronounce a syllable\n^1677146865730\n\nNon-verbal features do not affect the features of speech, while paralinguistic features (cough, laugh, breath, aka vocal effects) do impact my speech, meaning you can still hear them. \n\n### Phonological Patterning #card\n- Alliteration: seven slippery snakes\n- Assonance: he claps his hands and puts them in the sand\n- Consonance: Mike likes his new bike\n- Onomatopoeia: boom, crash, brrrrrr\n- Rhythm: I'm going down like a bottle of whiskey\n- Rhyme: The cat and the hat, sat on a mat\n^1677146865731\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.282321822Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/Subsystems/Quiz":{"title":"Quiz!","content":"#subsystem #englang \n\n## Phonetics \u0026 Phonology\nWhat is the difference between phonetics and phonology? :: Phonetics studies speech sounds, and is not related to any language, while phonology studies the sound system of a particular language ^1685840741145\n\nWhat is the difference between phonemic and phonetic transcription? :: Phonemic transcription is **broad** (the intended phonemes of the general language), and phonetic is **narrow** (more detail on how the actual sounds are pronounced) ^1685841049197\n\nWhat are the prosodic features? :: The prosodic features (aka suprasegmental features) are **stress, pitch, intonation, tempo** and **volume**.

Nonetheless, our nations are built on a notion of democracy that is flawed without this freedom, the ability to be able to articulate opinions and thoughts without the fear of being censored or face legal consequences. Time and time again, this right has been used to defend hate speech, and though freedom of speech definitely gives people the right to use hate speech, as it always has done, this does not mean people are exempt from any form of retaliation.\n\nVery frequently when people say that their freedom of speech is being violated, what they actually mean is that they are upset that people do not agree with them. In no way has anyone physically stopped them from saying ludicrous or hateful things, they have just faced retaliation for the harmful messages they are spreading. Such petty individuals seemingly miss the point of the concept: they are allowed to say what they want and let people listen, but what people do when they hear the message is up to the people and the people alone.\n\nIn some extreme cases, hate speech *will* be removed, or in other words, the opinion of the speaker is being censored. This in most cases can be seen as a consequence of the impact of the message, not the idea the message carries itself. Once again, they have fully been able to voice their opinion, and it is not being silenced by some tyrannical regime, but has rather been removed due to active harm that is being caused to others. Does it not make sense that if a message online is hypothetically teaching children how to make explosives that cause property damage, it would be removed and erased? This is simply correct not because it is censoring a message of being able to defend yourself, but because it is hurting landowners and the kids it influences. There is always a line, and though the edges near that line can be blurry, someone has to be able to apply moral judgement to the outcome of messages as to prevent easily preventable actions.\n\nIn conclusion, freedom of speech is a wonderful right that should apply to us all, including allowing the use of any kind of speech. This being said, hate speech can and will be removed from certain platforms if it is actively causing harm, an image the platforms would not like to convey, and people are welcome to find other ways to express their opinions. People disagreeing with an opinion is clearly not a violation of your freedom of speech, as encouraged discourse is the whole idea behind the concept, and people of all ages should be free to form their own opinions with all information available to them.","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.282321822Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/Transition-Period/Interesting-English-Language-Articles":{"title":"Interesting English Language Articles","content":"\n#englang #research\n1. The Scots Language\n\tThis is a really interesting article I found through [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP-PV9ryXM4) by xidnaf, and it talked about when a language actually becomes a different language. The line seems to be *really* blurry surprisingly.\n\t\n\tThe video mentions that linguists actually split languages by mutual intelligibility, so if people can understand each other even though some words are different or dialects/accents are different, the language is the same.\n\t\n\tThis still has its own problems though, because for example the Chinese \"languages\" are referred to as dialects even though they can't exactly understand each other, but they still use the same writing system, so you're in the weird position of they speak different languages, but they write in the same one ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯\n\t\n\tDialect Continuums are also a thing which is cool, overall there's just quite a big range. Australian people might struggle to understand British people, not a different language, but could still maybe understand a *few* loan words in Arabic or such, and the range varies such as English with German etc.\n\t\n\tIt's also not symmetrical e.g. people from Denmark can understand people from Sweden a lot better than vice versa.\n\t\n\tAll in all, what even is a different language is basically up to what we call it, and in the end it's basically all politics funnily enough.\n\t\n\tAnd now we get the Scots Language! It split from Old English similar to modern English, which was spoken about 1000 years ago in Britain. This is completely seperate to Scottish mind you, but is rather a remnant of what Old English was like.\n\t\n\tHere's a demonstration of the Scot's Language which can be found [here](https://youtu.be/cENbkHS3mnY) and helped demonstrate the concept of mutual intelligibility, which is quite common in other places but not so much for native English speakers\n\t \n\thttps://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/scots-language\n\n2.

Though there are exceptions, the most common of which being onomatopoeic words such as *whoosh*, *slurp*, *pop* and so on, most words in general are arbitrary.\n^1685778274083\n\n## Structure and Creativity #card\nHuman language is an open system that can be added to and combined and recombined in many ways to create new forms. Random units of sound which don't have meaning in of themselves combine to form meaningful morphemes or words. Animals generally don't have this ability, where one sound means one action, and cannot be split up into individual pieces to be reconstructed. Male grasshoppers have the ability to say one of 6 messgages; humans have the ability to talk about literally anything we want. We can even talk about things that don't exist!\n^1685778274087\n\n## Cultural Transmission #card\nHuman language depends on cultural transmission. It is not genetic and instinctual like a dog barking, who will bark the same wherever they go, but is rather learnt from the environment. A cantonese born child growing up in an English speaking house will speak English, it is not something defined inherantly but by the people around the child. Similarly, a bird isolated from any contact will still sing songs, but humans isolated from any society will not be able to speak any languages until they start learning from contact with people around them.\n^1685778274090\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.342324478Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/What-is-a-Language/Key-Terms":{"title":"Key Terms","content":"#englang \n\n## Dialectal Variation #card \nVariation associated with the language of a particular locality, region or geographical area.\n^1678180892654\n\n## Flipping #card \nTerm used to suggest rapid semantic change in a word from its original meaning to its opposite (or near opposite).\n^1678180892684\n\n## Orthographical Variation #card \nHow the use of symbols, letters and spellings varies among language users.\n^1678180892687\n\n## Phonological Variation #card \nHow the sounds of a language vary among different speakers (accent)\n^1678180892690\n\n## Semantic Variation #card \nHow word (and phrase) meanings vary from place to place and group to group\n^1678180892693\n\n## Social Variation #card \nVariation associated with a particular social group i.e., social class or educational background.\n^1678180892696\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.342324478Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/What-is-a-Language/Variables-of-Communication":{"title":"Variables of Communication","content":"#englang #notes\n\nIn [[English Language]] Units 1 - 4 we will be using these variables to annotate texts:\n\n## Mode #card\nThe medium of communication\n- **Written**\n- **Spoken**\n- **Sign**\n^1685778339519\n\n## Register #card\nFormality and respect level, the way a person speaks in respect to their audience\n- **Intimate**: people you know really well, close\n- **Casual**: the way we speak every day to one another, varies from more formal to less in of itself\n- **Consultative**: where there is an uneven power relationship, i.e. doctor patient, student teacher\n- **Formal**: one way, so a speech or letter. maybe meeting the queen lol\n- **Frozen**: things that don't change, such a marriage ceremony, beginning of a sermon, starting of a high court, welcome to country\n^1685778339591\n\n## Context #card\nEstablished background/circumstance, situation surrounding text\n- Situational\n- Cultural\n- Historical\n^1685778339597\n\n## Audience #card\nThe demographic that your are speaking to\n^1685778339603\n\n## Function #card\nPurpose of communication, what we are hoping to gain\n- What is the text set out to do\n- Social purpose, e.g. building rapport, encouraging group membership\n^1685778339610\n\n## Field #card\nHow specialised the communication is, area of interest + subject area\n^1685778351773\n\n## Setting #card\nWhere the communication is taking place\n^1685778317157\n\n\u003cmark style=\"background: #F9C74F;\"\u003e# MR CAFS\u003c/mark\u003e\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.342324478Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/What-is-a-Language/What-is-a-Language":{"title":"What is a Language?","content":"\n#englang #research \n## Definition 1\n### Source: [Language Meaning \u0026 Concept | What is Language? - Video \u0026 Lesson Transcript | Study.com](https://study.com/learn/lesson/language-meaning-concept.html)\n### Definition:\nEssentially, language is a term for any complex communication system used by humans that consists of words and phrases that, when combined, can create infinite variable utterances. How humans initially developed language is not wholly clear and is something that linguists are still researching. Most humans learn at least one language in early childhood. If a person lacks exposure to language as a young child, they will never be able to fluently learn a language as an adult because of how human brain development works.\n\n---\n## Definition 2\n### Source: [What is Language | IGI Global](https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/using-lean-method-in-english-language-classes/16613)\n### Definition:\nSystem for the expression of thoughts, feelings, etc., by the use of spoken sounds or convention symbols.\n\n---\n## Definition 3\n### Source: [what is language? : linguistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/bw37zc/what_is_language/)\n### Definition:\nA language is defined as a being an open system of communication. In other words, new symbols can be freely added to the system. For example, if I say that I define \"vlirsnik\" to mean \"the feeling of learning something new\" I can add it to this system of communication we are using right now and you will be able to understand it. Therefore, this is a language.\n\n---\n## What is common to your three definitions?\nAll three of the definitions mention that languages are a communication system, that try to express thoughts, ideas and feelings. They also mention that they have a common set of conventions that allow for a practically infinite set of meanings to be added.\n\n---\n## In your own words explain the word \"language\"\nA language is a set of communication standards that aim to convey meaning in the form of ideas, concepts, thoughts and feelings. This is done in a way that ideas can be added to these said conventions to be able to convey new concepts that were previously not expressible, therefore being modular in its usage.","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.342324478Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/Literature":{"title":"Literature","content":"\n#lit #subject \n## Unit 1\n### AoS 1: The Penelopiad\n- Read an extract from [[A Thousand Ships Extract|A Thousand Ships]] and annotate, and then compare and contrast it with [[Calliope and the Painting|a painting]]\n- Read [[Chapter 1]] of The Penelopiad and write about how [[Atwood]] comments on [[Culture \u0026 Society- The Penelopiad|Culture and Society]]\n- Write a short 200 word essay on a quote from [[Chapter 6]]\n- Write about the maids' [[Cold Eyed Teenaged Killer|cold eyed teenaged killer]], Telemachus\n- Write a [[The Obstacle To Go Through|creative piece]] on Chapter 6\n- Do a close passage analysis on [[The Birth of Telemachus Close Analysis|the birth of Telemachus]]\n- Comment on [[Relationships|relationships]] in Chapter 12\n- Comment on [[Penelope as a Narrator|Penelope as a narrator]] in Chapter 15\n- Explore the significance of a passage from Chapter 18, [[News Of Helen|News of Helen]]\n- Explore [[Chapter 24]] and what it says about the eyes of the beholder\n- What is the significance of [[Truth and Storytelling]] in the novel.\n- [[What is The Penelopiad About?|What is The Penelopiad even about?]]\n- Analyse the quote, [[In Death I Know Everything|\"Now that I am dead I know everything.\"]]\n- Create an [[Oral Presentation Script|Oral Presentation]] on any extract of ur choosing in the Penelopiad","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.342324478Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Invisible/Question-Documents/44-to-1h12-Minutes":{"title":"44 to 1h12 Minutes","content":"#lit #questions #flashwrite \n\n1) What lie does Tor tell the police officer?\nShe tells the police officer that she hasn't met El at all.\n\n2) How does the detective try to blackmail Tor into giving him information about her brother?\nHe says that if she doesn't tell him the truth, they will remove her mother's status of ease.\n\n3) What new command does Tor give Rose if she is in danger? Why does she do this?\nShe tells Rose to delete all information about her and all memories, because she does not want to be tracked or found.\n\n4) True or false: even if Rose deletes all memories of Tor, she will still remember the shapes and patterns that Tor has taught her.\nTrue\n\n5) What is Cal concerned about? What does he want Tor to do?\nHe is concerned that Tor is throwing away everything that she has earned and her whole life for her brother who she hasn't seen in so long. He wants Tor to just forget about it.\n\n6) “It’s never going to be for old people, is it? It was always going to be a two-way mirror. We see what we want to see; they see everything.” Explain what Cal means by this.\nHe says that Tor knows what she is creating, and she is safe creating something that helps her company spy on people, that Rose is meant for surveillance not \"helping old people\".

The information that is not said or expressed but is in between people. Moments that are shared through silence.\n\n8) Who is Leith?\nEl's son.\n\n9) Why did El leave?\nTo go and marry a woman that he loved who did not have status of ease.\n\n10) “I can make patterns of the world, recognise, splice, relearn behaviour, but there is something between them which I cannot see.

How long has it been since she has seen him?\nTor sees her brother on the news, and it's been 17 years since she's seen him.\n\n3)    What consequences is Cal concerned about if Tor goes out to find him?\nCal is concerned that Tor will get caught on surveillance and be mistaken as a defacer, and that their status of ease won't mean anything if she goes outside to look for him.\n\n4)    What does the man at Westminster mean when he tells Tor, “you’re talking to the invisible”? What is implied about the setting by this?\nIt is implied that he was never here, but also that she is talking to someone who was never registered and that cannot be seen by any digital systems. This \"invisible\" person will never be tracked, so it is the same as Tor never having talked to anyone.\n\n5)    Why is Tor’s mum reluctant to use her Rose?\nShe doesn't like the use of technology everywhere, because she feels like she will wend up becoming too dependant on it and she wants to be able to do things herself.\n\n6)    What does Rose find so difficult to interpret about the conversation between Tor and her mother?\nThe emotions and expressions that she was not programmed to register. She find it really hard to understand how they are feeling or what they are thinking about each other, because their feelings do not fall into the cookie cutter definitions of what people normally feel. She sats she can't understand the blank expression and the things that are left unsaid.\n\n7)    Rose says, “And I wonder what it is like to stand and look at the sky. I can make a sky, but I cannot look at it. I can conjure a sea but I cannot experience its coldness.” What does she appear to be yearning for here?\nShe appears to be yearning for feeling and touch, similar to how humans feel it. She appears to be yearning for being human.\n\n8)    What does Tor suspect has been hidden from the people of London?\nTor suspects that photos and information and the old plans of the city have been hidden from everyone.\n\n9)    What is unusual about the library in Charing Cross Road? Why does Cal fear it will be dangerous?\nBecause it is not registered anywhere and is run by people off the books, otherwise known as defacers.\n\n10) Why is Rose unable to see inside the “mind” of the library?\nBecause none of it is digital. She cannot index what is not digital so it is all isolated from her.\n\n12) What does Tor discover about the Circle Line by consulting the A – Z?\nThat it is in fact not a circle, it is not just a circuit but there is a leg that travels outwards. This leg has been hidden and removed from all the maps everywhere.\n\n14) What is outside the borders of London?\nLadbroke Grove, and the rest of the leg. London was most likely isolated as an island after some great floods that isolated it from the rest of the country, and people no longer travel inside and outside the place.\n\n16) How might Tor be able to get there?\nApparently there is a \"ghost train\" that travels sometime at night and takes people out of the central area outside of London, This is how she plans to get there.\n\n17) “This is a library. You can open a book and read something, close it, forget it, but it’s still there. It exists, even if we don’t think about it.” Discuss the significance of this statement.\nThis links back to the title of the show. It is all invisible, but the information is still there even if you forget it. Information is always there when it is in its hard copy, but when it becomes digital it can all go away, even when people do not think about it. There is a lot behind the eyes of what we don't actively think about, a lot that is hidden.","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.342324478Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Invisible/Question-Documents/Eight-Minute-Questions":{"title":"Eight Minute Questions","content":"#theinvisible #questions #lit \n\n1. \"She continually expands in ways of thinking.\" \"I taught her to ask questions.\" (Tor on Rose).

As such we are positioned to have sympathy towards Rose and treat her as more than just a machine.\n\n2. List the clues about setting in the first seven to eight minutes of the play. Make an inference from these clues.

This is slightly unnerving, as an AI trying to grapple with human emotions may not fully understand the implications of that statement, because a lot of the time even humans don't interpret that correctly.

This observational tone combined with propositions such as, \"Perhaps he hasn't thought of what it is like to be me,\" allow the extract to form a clear image of how Calliope feels in the situation she describes: she is not understood and she is alone in her suffering. She questions her reality a lot, the need for it and the purpose behind it. Rhetorical questions such as, \"Can he really believe he has something new to say?\" or \"How much epic poetry does the world really need?\" all play into this narrative of it all being unnecessary, that none of it is required and is all built up on a greed for more fame and wealth and money, forgetting the true purpose behind any of in the first place.\n\nThe author also uses anaphora as a staple in Calliope's voice, utilising the repetition to highlight the monotony and \"foreverness\" of this situation.

She has been lost in the shadows for all her life, so she wants to be able to portray her side of the story, and get it all out there because she never could while she was alive.\n\nShe had to suffer so much just because of her husband, and she doesn't want others to go down the same path of suffering needlessly. She wants to be known as more than just a faithful wife, but her own person. The weaponisation of [[Penelope|Penelope's]] character not only makes them suffer more, but further excuses the behaviour of the men.\n\n\u003e Comment on the tone used here and give an example\n\nThe tone of the chapter is very sombre, and and reminiscent. She feels sad that her life never amounted to too much, but she is determined now to tell her story when she can. She says now that no one cares, that it didn't matter at all, but she's waited for so long that she can finally find a little bit of motivation because there is nothing left to lose. \n\nShe is also almost slightly resentful towards Odysseus. She talks about his characters and how she was played the fool, holding a bit of a grudge but condemning herself for not acting on it sooner. \"I turned a blind eye, I kept my mouth shut or if I opened it, I sang his praises\". This rescinded tone, where she sounds so defeated and tired doesn't see herself as anyone perfect but is rather very self critical. She talks about her blissful ignorance, but in death she realises that she was dragged through the mud, and now she wants to set the record straight. \n\n\u003e What is meant by \"A stick used to beat other women with\"?\n\nPeople weaponise [[Penelope|Penelope's]] faithfulness and use that as a measuring bar to compare other women with. So [[Penelope|Penelope's]] faithfulness, rather than being celebrates, is used to degrade other women and further pushes the status quo that women are defined by their husbands. Keeping that loyalty was actually something that hurt her, and she doesn't want others to follow her example because it just makes the lives of others worse.","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.342324478Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/Chapters/Chapter-24":{"title":"Chapter 24","content":"\n\u003e [!info]\n\u003e \n\u003e What does this chapter suggest about perception and the way it changes based on the subject and the beholder?\n\nThis chapter shows us the maid's perception of their own story, told through a historical lens where they interpret themselves to be the three followers of Artemis, a god who is viewed favourably. They assign symbolism to themselves, similar to how the Odyssey and other tales do to deeply interpret their lives as metaphors for something greater. Atwood explores how the perception of a story changes from person to person and lens to lens. We look at the story for a modern view, linking it to what it tells us about our society as *we* know it, but for the maids, the world may have very well meant something very different. The observer, looking at themselves, sees a very different life from the audience who are watching the maids from their point of view.","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.342324478Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/Chapters/Chapter-6":{"title":"Chapter 6","content":"#lit #thepenelopiad #chapter \n\n\u003e [!quote] Prompt\n\u003e \n\u003e \"If you can't go through an obstacle, go around it.\" What do you think Penelope's mother might be implying here about Penelope's marriage to Odysseus?  What does this suggest about the world of the text?\n\nPenelope's mother might be implying that her marriage with Odysseus is an obstacle in and of itself. In the text, marriage is mandatory, not being a choice of the bride at all but rather something she has to live through for the rest of her life without her own approval. Penelope's mother implies that life will always keep throwing obstacles at Penelope, one after the other, but she has to smarter than what she faces and find a way to get around it, to live through what comes her way using her \"one redeeming quality\", her brain.\n\nThe quote shows that the world that the text is set in is far from favourable to the women in it, expecting them all to be happy with what is given to them while demanding docility. Penelope's mother is well versed in this world of hardships that cannot be expressed on her face, having to be dealt with behind a facade, so she advises her child to do the same: to use her smarts to outwit the challenge of marriage that comes her way, and to try and live happily despite the unideal scenario the world places her in against her own will.","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.342324478Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/Cold-Eyed-Teenaged-Killer":{"title":"Cold Eyed Teenaged Killer","content":"#lit #flashwrite \n\n\u003e [!question] \n\u003e \n\u003e How and why does Atwood compare the maids and their \"cold eyed teenaged killer\", Telemachus? 200 words\n\nAtwood makes the comparison between Telemachus and the maids, highlighting parallels, stating that they were \"infants when he was an infant, wailing just as he wailed, helpless as he was helpless, but ten times more helpless as well\". Quotes like this create a defined distinction between the maids and Telemachus, they are one in the same besides their status at birth, their power. \n\nThey are both human, they both have the same mortal flesh, they were both born in the same location at the same time, but one was given every power that they could wish for and the other \"found\". Atwood makes this active comparison to make the audience think about what the maids did to deserve their fate, a fate they could never have controlled no matter how much they wished to. \n\nThe maids implore the reader to \"Ask the Three Sisters, [...] Only they know how events might then have been altered\". This metaphor of the Three Fatal Sisters explores the idea that the ability to change one's fate is inherently linked with power, and those who are the bottom of the hierarchy can't change anything no matter how much they tried because nothing would change. \n\nThe maids and Telemachus are the same, but yet just due to their birth they are fated completely seperate lives.","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.342324478Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/Culture-Society-The-Penelopiad":{"title":"Culture \u0026 Society- The Penelopiad","content":"#lit #flashwrite #thepenelopiad \n\n\u003e In re-writing The Penelopiad, what assumptions and ideas about culture and society is Atwood seeking to question?\n\n[[Atwood]] aims to question the idea that there is one true tale for the events of a story. Never is there just one side, and all too often we take the side of power, because those who have power tell the tale. These ideas are taken as the truth, without question from anyone, but [[Atwood]] aims to question these tales taken as truth.

[[Atwood]] is seeking to question the assumption that wives have to be so faithful, so ever loving, despite any actions of the husband, that a relationship is the wife's job and her's alone, an idea that is still deeply rooted in our society.","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.342324478Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/In-Death-I-Know-Everything":{"title":"In Death I Know Everything","content":"#lit #thepenelopiad #flashwrite \n\n\u003e [!info]\n\u003e \n\u003e \"Now that I am dead I know everything.\" (Penelope) To what extent do you consider this to be true in Margaret Atwood's The Penelopiad?\n\nPenelope says she knows everything in death, but throughout the novel, this is contradicted time and time again. Atwood writes about the theme of truth, ad how there is no single truth that can be confirmed but rather many stories from many different perspectives, a world of lies and deceit for anyone to make their own tale. There is no truth for Penelope to know, there simply isn't anything that can be confirmed or known. She says it herself: \"*Now that I'm dead I know everything.* This is what I wished would happen, but like so many of my wishes it failed to come true\". Atwood tells us that there is no truth, or even that the truth doesn't matter, only stories and perspectives and people and their lives.","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.342324478Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/News-Of-Helen":{"title":"News Of Helen","content":"#flashwrite #lit #thepenelopiad #chapter \n\n\u003e [!info] Section A Question 1\n\u003e \n\u003e Explore the significance of the passage in the text\n\nThis passage takes place in Chapter 18, News of Helen, as Telemachus successfully arrives back from his voyage, one he went on without consulting or asking Penelope. The extract further establishes the struggle for power in the world of the text, with an \"ambush\" always set out to dethrone those in power. Further, the extract furthers our understanding of entitlement and power.\n\nTelemachus mentions how \"he didn't need anyone's permission to take a boat\", while the chapter previous told us of the maids dreaming about boats, to be able to escape. This entitlement, to be able to take whatever he wants furthers the audience's understanding of the motif of boats and water that permeates the novel, representing a sense of agency and being able to enact your own will, having the power to make a change. The extract makes it evident that Telemachus has no sense of consequences, where he was saved \"more by good luck than good planning\", showing how those with power born into high status can so often disregard the outcomes of their actions. \n\nThe passage is crucial to understanding Telemachus' views and inherent entitlement to power, and whenever the patriarchy is defied in any way, such as Penelope doing “what was usually considered a man’s business”, he gets \"irritated by it\" expressing that he needs to \"\\[get] out from under the thumbs of the women\".  Atwood uses this idea to further push and reinforce the idea that children are a product of society's values and flaws, and there was no difference between the maids and Telemachus at birth, only the way that the world treated them. It also furthers our understanding of gender roles within the novel, where once again Penelope is stripped from her individual identity, being referred to as \"the women\", where her gender defines her even to her own son.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.342324478Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/Odyssey":{"title":"Odyssey","content":"#lit #book\n\nThe Odyssey is a tale by Homer about the epic adventures of the Greek king Odysseus.

Snuff, as defined by the Oxford Dictionary, is the action of extinguishing a candle or a flame, almost like the maids were stamped out, like a dying meaningless flicker of life, and it sets us up well for the power dynamic that is to come.\n\nHere we can see an excerpt the chapter, analysed through the lens of Storytelling, Truth and Voice. Atwood explores the different interpretations of truth in this passage, an exchange between Penelope and Eurycleia, \"who could not disguise her gloating pleasure\" at the killing of the maids and the suitors. Penelope uses harsh language to describe the scene, words such as \"hacked\", \"genitals\" and \"agonising screams\" while describing Melanthius as a \"poor man\" that was thrown to the dogs. This builds a sympathetic view towards the suitors that otherwise were so hated throughout the novel. But why does Atwood want us to feel sympathetic towards these barbaric men? \n\nI believe this is where the underlying theme of a lack of voice and agency comes through, one which is heavily endorsed by this chapter, showing Penelope's lack of agency leaving her in the shambles. \"I bit my tongue. It's a wonder I had any tongue left, so frequently had I bitten it over the years.\" Atwood wants the audience to understand that within the novel, voice and agency is only given to those born with it: men of high status like Telemachus or Odysseus. Melanthius is at their whim, Penelope is at their command, and the maids die at their hands, whenever they choose. Odysseus is allowed to come in and impose himself upon everything in Penelope's life, killing all the suitors and brutally torturing the maids, because he has decided that \"they were notorious whores.\"\n\nEven so, Penelope blames herself, stating that \"I hadn't told her of my scheme\" and this lack of ability to express herself results in pain for others, showing that despite it being her choice not to talk, she is inherently limited by her lower status as a women within the novel. She so willingly hands her fortune over to the man in her life, not valuing her own agency or what she has built up, but rather only the validation of Odysseus, further shown by how dismissive she is of the maids death, because Odysseus can do whatever he likes! \"What could I do? Lamentation wouldn't bring my lovely girls back to life\". \"Dead is dead\". Yet she still values herself in relation to him, saying she'll have to mourn the girls in secret, \"or Odysseus will suspect me as well\". Evidently this chapter heavily endorses the lack of agency given to women and people of lower class at the time, Penelope left helpless.\n\nThe chapter also endorses and challenges the idea that those with power, those with voice, get to tell their story which then becomes the truth. The two different interpretations of the truth are very clear in this extract: Eurycleia believes in the \"impertinent\" girls, \"the ones who’d been rude. The ones who used to thumb their noses at me\". Eurycleia very well believes this to be true, not told otherwise by a voiceless Penelope. So when Odysseus sees this \"truth\", or rather this story that Penelope has so cleverly manufactured, he takes it at face value and has the agency to do whatever he likes with it. So not only does Penelope have the power to turn her own stories into a reality, but a lot of the time counterintuitively, as her lack of voice still means she is powerless in other aspects. Overall, this idea that the wealthy can write their own story is challenged, because though Penelope has status, she is still in the shadow of the men in her life, but this idea that gender and birthright can allow you to decide what is true is heavily endorsed by Atwood throughout the extract.\n\nUltimately, Atwood presents this passage as a commentary on voice and storytelling, and how status and power influences agency throughout the wider novel. Many characters are directly compared and contrasted, making the Penelopiad a profound demonstration of relationships and power dynamics in the real world, not only seeping into every corner of the novel but also reflecting our biases, privilege and viewpoints in the world around us.","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.342324478Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/Penelope":{"title":"Penelope","content":"#lit #thepenelopiad #character\n\nPenelope is the main character of The Penelopiad, and presented as the wife of Odysseus in Homer's story, The [[Odyssey]].

Why do you think she chooses to present Penelope's character in this way?  Use evidence from chapter 15, The Shroud, to support your point of view.\n\nThroughout Chapter 15, we get a glimpse as to why Penelope may not be the most reliable of narrators throughout the novel. In general, the recount of the events in the story are quite opinionated, clouded by a judgement from one side and experience, and as such there can never be one \"truth\" because all experiences will be under some lens or the other.\n\nWe keenly get this idea when Penelope speaks of the maids, who are supposedly her children whom for she cares a lot. Despite this, she still allows for horrid things to happen to them such as being raped by the suitors, occurrences that she describes as almost inevitable with no remorse or sympathy. Further, she describes them as her \"eyes and ears around the castle\", pawns that she uses for her own individual purposes to their detriment. Nonetheless, the story is portrayed from the perspective of Penelope, meaning that all of these flaws of her character are obfuscated behind the lens of her narration.","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.342324478Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/Relationships":{"title":"Relationships","content":"#flashwrite #lit #analysis \n\n\u003e [!info]\n\u003e \n\u003e Comment on the theme of relationships as reflected in chapter xii, Waiting\n\nRelationships in Chapter 12, Waiting, are viewed almost as transactional with defined purposes in a very cold and non-compassionate manner. Atwood uses the chapter to express the idea that women are so often left behind and discarded in relationships, with Odysseus just leaving with not much more than a word, causing everything to blur into one monotonous cycle. All she did was wait for news in of Odysseus, further pushing the idea that her only worth is in relation to him.\n\nThe chapter also explores the idea that men have no consequences for their actions, and that anything they do will be glorified and portrayed as a wonderful tale, whereas the women's actions will never be credited to them, simply given to the man who did nothing. Atwood describes a Penelope who dreams of a day, \"Odysseus returning and \\[her] - with womanly modesty - revealing to him how well \\[she] had done at what was usually considered a man's business. On his behalf, of course\". It all had to be on his behalf, because within the text women have no voice at all or any individuality when removed for their male counterpart. Unlike Penelope, Odysseus could do anything, flirt with anyone, even Helen who \"had bathed him and anointed him with her very own hands\" and there were meant to be no consequences, because he can do whatever he pleases.\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.342324478Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/The-Birth-of-Telemachus-Close-Analysis":{"title":"The Birth of Telemachus Close Analysis","content":"#lit #flashwrite #analysis\n\n\u003e [!info] \n\u003e \n\u003e Comment on how the passage illustrates the theme of power and powerlessness\n\nThroughout the passage, Atwood uses the motif of water and ocean to represent the power dynamic of the world she has built. The ones who hold the power, Telemachus, Odysseus, the Gods, all use water as a medium to enact their will. Telemachus' birth was not just a birth, it was a \"nine-month voyage\" to be celebrated, as was the great tale of Odysseus who travelled the many seas with great feats. At the same time, Atwood uses the metaphor of water to show how helpless those without power can be. The same power of the ocean just spat the maid out, \"beached at the same time he was\". They were simply spat out, discarded and sub-human, with words such as spawned and appeared describing their inherent inhumanity.\n\nAtwood also uses a combination of anaphora and juxtaposition to directly compare Telemachus and the maids. \"**Infants** when he was an **infant**, **wailing** just as he **wailed**,\" a repetition of the same words to emphasise the point that they apply to directly both the maids and Telemachus. At the same time, the enjambment of lines such as \"wailing just\" and \"as he wailed\" makes the reading more uncomfortable, expressing the idea that though they are identical in almost every way, the wail of a prince is still not equal to the wail of a servant girl. \n\nAtwood uses this mechanism to comment on an important aspect of our modern society: all children are born the same and equal, but it is society's ideals that create imbalance. The environment around Telemachus, not Telemachus himself, is what caused his wail to be any different from the others, and when he grows up being told he is entitled to a kingdom and the lives of those within it, he thus believes so, evident by Penelope's description in Chapter 15, that “\\[Telemachus] was starting to look at \\[her] in an odd way, holding \\[her] responsible for the fact that his inheritance was being literally gobbled up.” \n\nThe excessive use of pronouns in this passage also creates the effect of dehumanising everyone involved. The maids, as always are referred to as a collective, but Telemachus is also never referred to by name, rather as a mysterious \"he\". This lack of definitive character portrays Telemachus as someone who is much more sinister than otherwise, an amalgamation and representation of the power imbalance in their world, causing him to be the antagonist in this poem. The repetitive use of short quick phrases and many verbs also gives the reader a sense that the maids are *objects* built for doing things with, further commenting on the humanity of this conglomeration of broken, unwanted children.","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.342324478Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/The-Obstacle-To-Go-Through":{"title":"The Obstacle To Go Through","content":"#lit #thepenelopiad #flashwrite \n\n\u003e [!quote]\n\u003e \n\u003e \"It's hope, and hope only, that keeps us afloat.\" (Chapter 7 The Chorus Line: If I Was a Princess, A Popular Tune)\n\n**Water**, crashing against the hull of our fate as we hurl further and further into the ocean's **waves**.

Oh how I wish I had the hope she did.*\n\n*This nameless girl, the girl of hopes and dreams, she frolicked around the paddocks and fields, until one day she met a man. Now they frolicked together instead, a pair of inseparable nature, the hope gleaming from one to the other, until one day, he got down on one knee and asked the question every girl wants to here: \"Will you be mine?\"*\n\n*She said yes, but like us all, she didn't realise. It was a loan. He gave her hope, she gave him herself. \"Will you be mine?\" Surely she thought \"Oh, why yes of course!\" rather than whats she should have thought: \"Well of course I'll be yours! Until death do us part, I will be your property, with modesty, I'll do whatever you please, I'm properly **yours**\"*\n\n*So she was his, the same as all brides in any marriage, and when it all came to an end, he came to collect her hope as well*","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.342324478Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/Truth-and-Storytelling":{"title":"Truth and Storytelling","content":"#flashwrite #thepenelopiad #lit \n\n\u003e [!danger] Truth vs Storytelling\n\u003e \n\u003e What do you understand about truth and storytelling in the novel?\n\nThese chapters tell us some key information about how the world of the Penelopiad views the truth and myth.

Men place such deep value on their lives, over interpreting the mundane and making that their own truth. Each Chorus Line chapter is a different rendition of this truth, told in a great variety of mediums from many different stories and perspectives, highlighting a key idea that Atwood tries to express: the truth is what we make it.

In countless retellings and recounts, what is considered to be true or the relevance of a truth even mattering is warped and moulded, recontextualised to be timeless and universal. Such is demonstrated by Margaret Atwood's 2005 novel \u003cu\u003eThe Penelopiad\u003c/u\u003e, which retells and appropriated Homer's epic, \u003cu\u003eThe Odyssey\u003c/u\u003e from the perspective of Penelope, an otherwise overshadowed character. Atwood reshapes the narrative to reflect contemporary contexts and values, and tells a story that is pertinent to our society. \u003cu\u003eThe Penelopiad\u003c/u\u003e is a book about truth and power, and how those who have the voice and power are the ones that decide what is true, holding the lives of other in the palm of their hand.\n\nOne of the main themes of the book is truth: who the story is told by. Penelope states that \"many people have believed that \\[Odysseus's] version of events was the true one\", so to set the record straight \"\\[she'll] spin a thread of \\[her] own\". Atwood brings up the idea, time and time again, that people with power (in most cases men) are the ones who have the ability to dictate what is true and what is not. Odysseus made up any fictitious remark about himself, deeply interpreting his own life, yet his account was taken as meaningful due to his reputation and position. This theme permeates the novel from the beginning to end, Penelope never getting a chance to tell her story while she was alive, and the maids still voiceless in death, all of which are structured in a power hierarchy that ruthlessly rips agency away from those born less notable. \n\nOn the counter-side to this, the novel is filled with deceit and lies. The same quote from above sees Penelope mention how \"\\[Odysseus] was always so plausible ... even I believed him from time to time\". Atwood wonders how Odysseus, actively known for his trickery and lies, still holds academic merit. She is haunted by these lies, where anyone with power can spin up their own tale and retell other people's truth, enacting it into reality. From the moment they meet, Penelope comments that “the way Odysseus told the story made me suspect there was more to it”, and this follows for the rest of her marriage, where she states “the two of us were...proficient and shameless liars of long standing. It was a wonder either of us believed a word the other said. But we did. Or so we told each other”.\n\nOverall, Atwood tells a story of how power is truth, more these days than ever. By recontextualising a novel told from the male perspective about glorified events embedded in myth, Atwood is able to use \u003cu\u003eThe Penelopiad\u003c/u\u003e as a means of touching on important societal issues such as sexism, wealth inequality and power imbalance, all through a unique but subtle novel that leaves the reader wondering one question: what was actually true?\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.342324478Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Physics/Electricity/Fundamentals-of-Electricity":{"title":"Fundamentals of Electricity","content":"#physics #electricity\n\n- Particles with \"charge\"\n\t- Subatomic $e^{-}, p^{+}$ \n- Coulomb - $6.24 \\times 10^{18}$ $e^{-}$ or $p^{+}$ \n\t- $\\therefore$ charge on $1e^{-}$ or $p^{+}$\n\t- $\\frac{1}{6.24 \\times 10^{18}} = 1.603 \\times 10^{-19}C$\n\n$m = \\textrm{mass in kg}$\n$q = \\textrm{charge in Coulomb} \\space (C)$\n$I = \\textrm{current in Amps} \\space \\frac{C}{S}$ or Q/T\ncoulombs per second\n\nVoltage $=\\frac{J}{C}$ (joules per coulomb)\nVoltage is Potential Difference, essentially the difference between two points\n$P = IV$, Power = Current $\\times$ Voltage\n$V = IR$, Voltage = Current $\\times$ Resistance\n$R=\\frac{V}{I}$ Resistance is in the unit $\\ohm$ (ohm)\n\n\\*$\\ohm = \\frac{m^{2}\\textrm{kg}}{s^{3}A^{2}}$ in S.I units, s = seconds, A = area\n\nResistance limits and controls $I$ in a circuit\n- The electrical potential energy of the charge carriers is turned into thermal energy \n- A resister is a load, so any load can be modelled by a resistor\n\nBy conventional direction: red wire is first, by electron direction, black is first","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.346324655Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Physics/Electricity/Ohms-Law":{"title":"Ohm's Law","content":"#physics #electricity \n\n\u003e [!note] Ohm's Law\n\u003e $V=IR$\n\u003e a higher P.D. $\\rightarrow$ higher current\n\u003e $\\therefore R=\\frac{V}{I}$\n\nIn a series circuit, current is constant.\n\n## Calculating Total Resistance\nSeries: $R_{t}=R_{1}+R_{2}+\\cdots+R_{n}$\nIn parallel: $\\frac{1}{R_{t}} = \\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\\frac{1}{R_{2}}\\cdots\\frac{1}{R_{n}}$ \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.346324655Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Physics/Logbook/13-2-2023":{"title":"13-2-2023","content":"#physics #prac\n\n![[Refraction with Pyrex.pdf]]\n\nAlso put data into an excel worksheet that you can find [[I_R_Snells law prac_20231.xlsx|here]], along with some questions from a word document [[CGS Refraction of light prac 2023.docx|here]]","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T00:23:08.346324655Z","tags":[]},"/notes/School-Subjects/Physics/Logbook/20-6-2023":{"title":"20-6-2023","content":"#physics #prac \n\n1.

The particles go out of reach of the attractive nature of the strong nuclear force and repel away from each other by the electromagnetic force.\n\n![[Attractive and replusive force in atomic nuclei.png]]\n\nStable isotopes usually require the strong force to be slightly stronger than the electrostatic force within the nucleus. This means the nucleus is more attracted to itself than it is repelled by itself.\n\n## Electro-magnetic Force #card \nThe force that attracts opposite charges and repels like charges. It has a strength of $\\frac{1}{137}$ and a range of infinity, and it has a greater effect than the strong force beyond a certain range, causing decayed nuclei to repel each other (alpha decay).\nExchange particle is a proton.\n^1681003399147\n\n## Weak Force #card \nThe force that allows quarks to rearrange themselves, so neutrino (short lived fundamental particle) interaction induces beta decay.
