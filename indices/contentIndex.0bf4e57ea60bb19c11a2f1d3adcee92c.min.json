The aim is to place them in a row such that no-one is in danger: no hunter is next to a wolf, no wolf is next to a goat, no goat is next to a cabbage. Also no two counters may be placed next to each other. How many ways are there to solve the puzzle?\n\nFirst you can write down the rules in the opposite way. The question defines what can't be next to what, so we can say what can be next to what.  \n  \nG can be next to H  \nH can be next to C \u0026 G  \nW can be next to C  \nC can be next to H \u0026 W  \n  \nThis can be visualised by turning each into its own node, and making arrows to what it can be next to:  \nW \u003c--\u003e C \u003c--\u003e H \u003c--\u003e G  \n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n1[Wolf] \u003c--\u003e Cabbage \u003c--\u003e Hunter \u003c--\u003e Goat\n```\n  \nEvidently from this we can see that for all n, the sequence must start at W or G, because if it does not we would not be able to have an equal amount of all counters. For example, for n = 1, we can do WCHG or GHCW. For n = 2 we can do, WCWCHGHG or GHGHCWCW, and so on, given our restriction of all counters being equal in number.  \n  \n‚à¥ We can conclude that for all n, there are two solutions, starting with either W or G  \n  \n(this ended up being quite a similar answer to Blake, great minds must think alike haha)","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T01:20:16.612597246Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Algorithmics/Weeks/Week-1/Task-3":{"title":"","content":"a) You could fill up the 3 litre jug, pour it into the 5 litre jug, fill up the 3 litre jug again, pour as much as you can into the 5 litre jug until it is full, meaning you will have 1 litre remaining in the 3 litre jug, and finally empty the 5 litre jug.

An example would be \"un-\"\n^1678180906342\n\nCan further be divided into 4 categories:\n- Prefix: *un*-happy\n- Suffix happi-*ness*\n- Infix: abso-*blooming*-lutely (only non-standard words in English)\n- Circumfix: *en*-light-*en*, same meaning of affixes ‚à¥ em-bold-en would have be an example of a circumfix\n  \n### Derivational vs Inflectional Morphemes\n#### Derivational Morphemes #card\n**Derivational morphemes** create or derive new words by changing the meaning or changing the word class of the word. For example, happy turns into unhappy, and both words are adjectives but the meaning changes.\n^1678180906349\n\n##### The Diminutive Suffix\nA diminutive creates a meaning of ‚Äòsmall‚Äô or ‚Äòlittle‚Äô (this can be literal or notional) The most common diminutives are formed with and with suffixes such as¬†_-let_¬†and¬†_-y_. We often use a diminutive with names or with abbreviated names when we want to be more informal, or to express affection for someone or something.\n- _Here‚Äôs a book**let**¬†which gives advice on keep-fit._¬†(_booklet_¬†= a small book)\n- _Right, Matt**y**, I‚Äôve got some very good news for you._¬†(_Matty_¬†is formed from the name ‚ÄòMatthew‚Äô)\n- _I think she‚Äôs the perfect kitt**y**¬†for Jennifer._¬†(_kitty_¬†is formed from ‚Äòkitten‚Äô a young cat)\n- What a cute little duck**ling**\n\n#### Inflectional Morphemes #card \n**Inflectional morphemes** don't alter the meaning or word class of a word; instead they only refine and give extra grammatical information about the word's already existing meaning. For example cat into cats or walk into walking.\n^1678180906352\n\nIn English, all inflectional morphemes are suffixes (only by chance, since in other languages this is not true) and there are 8 of them.\n- -s, 3rd person sg. present\n  \"He waits\"\n- -ed, past tense (also -t as in \"used to\" or \"spent\")\n  \"He waited\"\n- -ing, progressive\n  \"He is waiting\"\n- -en, past participle\n  \"I had eaten\"\n- -s, plural\n  \"Both chairs are broken\"\n- -'s, possessive\n  \"The chair's leg is broken\"\n- -er, comparative, can also be agentive but that's derivational\n  \"He was faster\"\n- -est, superlative\n  \"He was the fastest\"\n\n## Word Formations\n### Affixation\nForming new words by adding an extra bound morpheme, so an affix.\n\n### Compounding\nForming new words not from bound affixes but from two or more independent words: the words can be free morphemes, words derived by affixation, or even words formed by compounds themselves. e.g. girlfriend, blackbird\n\nBy putting stress on both words you seperate them into two words\n\n### Reduplication\nThis is forming new words either by doubling an entire free morpheme (total reduplication) or part of a morpheme (partial reduplication).\n\n### Blending\nWhere two words are merged together, such as:\n- brunch - from breakfast and lunch\n- smog - from smoke and fog\n- spork - from spoon and fork\n\n## The Parts of Speech\nA part of speech is a class of words based on the word's function, the way it works in a sentence. They are sometime's referred to as word classes.\n\n### Nouns #card\n'Noun' is the name given to words that name things or concepts.\nThere are many different types, or sub classes of nouns, some you will be familiar with, other maybe not.\n^1677146895726\n\n### Verbs #card\nVerbs are words that describe what a subject is doing. They also describe relationships between one thing and another, allowing us to place an event, state, etc. in the past, present or future. \n^1677146895729\n\n### Adjective #card\nA word that modifies or defines a noun, or a describing word. \n##### Degrees of Adjectives\n- Positive Degree: plain old adjective, e.g. happy\n- Comparative Degree: e.g. happier\n- Superlative Degree: e.g. happiest\n- Absolute: e.g. unique\n^1677146895731\n\n### Adverbs #card\nAdverbs are words that change, modify or qualify a verb, or another adjective/adverb. \n^1677146895733\n\n### Pronouns #card\nPronouns are words which we use in place of a noun, to avoid being repetitive.\nThe noun they replace is known as the antecedent. The antecedent doesn't always come before the pronoun that replaces it.\n^1677146895735\n\nSaying \"John did ....... He .......\" is **anaphoric reference**, whereas if the pronoun was before it would be **cataphoric reference**. \n\n### Prepositions #card\nAs the name suggests, a preposition places, links or connects words and phrases to other words and phrases within a sentence. Prepositions usually come directly before a noun in a sentence and can also precede a gerund verb (non-finite form, -ing version where it's being used as a noun \"shopping really annoys me\").\n^1677146895738\n\n### Conjunctions #card\nConjunctions connect words, phrases, clauses and sentences. They tell us the relationship between 'thoughts'.\n^1677146895740\n\n### Interjection #card\nAn interjection is a word or expression that occurs as an utterance on its own and expresses a spontaneous feeling or reaction.\nThe category is quite heterogeneous, and includes such things such as exclamations, curses, greetings, response particles, and hesitation markers.\n^1677146895742\n\n## Types of Writing Systems\n### Orthographic #card\nThis type of writing system is arbitrary and the language is \"represented\" in writing by something like an alphabet, such as English.\n^1677545865722\n\n### Iconographic #card\nThis type of writing system is less arbitrary and uses icons that visually represent what they're meant to mean, such as Chinese or Korean.\n^1677545865723\n\n## Accent and Dialect\nAccent is to do with how things are pronounced, purely to do with sound, while dialect is to do with words and the lexicon that people pull from. For example, a Yorkshire man may say tub instead of bath (a different dialect), but would still say grass and have it sound different.\n- **Accent**: style switching\n- **Dialect**: code switching\n\n### Definitions\n#### Jargon\nWords from any semantic field, namely specialist terminology that others won't understand\n#### Argo\n**A secret code**, the jargon or slang of a particular group or class (usually thought of lower class)\n#### Slang\nInformal language that is non-standard but something that isn't necessarily used by a particular group\n- Normally made to avoid detection to make it harder for certain groups to understand\n#### Colloquial Language\nConversational language that is informal\n#### Vernacular\nColloquial language or dialect that is regional\n- Street\n- Jive\n- Cant\n- Demotic\n- Idiomatic\n- Parlance\n- Patios\n- Phraseology\n- Archaic\n- Dialect, Sociolect and Idiolect\n#### Dialectal variation\nVariation associated with the language of a particular locality, region or geographical area. **one thing, multiple words**\n#### Flipping\nTerm used to suggest rapid semantic change in a word from its original meaning to its opposite (or near opposite)\n#### Orthographical variation\nHow the use of symbols, letters and spellings varies among language users\n#### Phonological variation\nHow the sounds of a language vary among different speakers (accent)\n#### Semantic variation\nHow word (and phrase) meanings vary from place to place and group to group. **one word, multiple things**\n#### Social variation\nVariation associated with a particular social group i.e., social class or educational background\n\n## Etymology\nThe study of the history of use and origins of words.\n\n### Examples\n- **Sandwich (n.):** \n  1762, said to be a reference to John Montagu (1718-1792), 4th Earl of¬†Sandwich, who was said to be an inveterate gambler who ate slices of cold meat between bread at the gaming table during marathon sessions rather than rising for a proper meal (this account of the origin dates to 1770).\n  \n  It also was in his honor that Cook named the Hawaiian islands (1778) when Montagu was first lord of the Admiralty (hence the occasional 19c. British¬†**Sandwicher**¬†for \"a Hawaiian\"). The family name is from the place in Kent, one of the Cinque Ports, Old English¬†Sandwic√¶, literally \"sandy harbor (or trading center).\"\n\n- **Berserk (adj.):**\n  1844, from¬†berserk¬†(n.) \"Norse warrior\" (by 1835), an alternative form of¬†[berserker](https://www.etymonline.com/word/berserker?ref=etymonline_crossreference \"Etymology, meaning and definition of berserker\"), a word which was introduced (as¬†berserkar) by Sir Walter Scott in \"The Pirate\" (1822), from Old Norse¬†berserkr¬†(n.) \"raging warrior of superhuman strength.\" It is probably from¬†*ber-¬†\"bear\" +¬†serkr¬†\"shirt,\" thus literally \"a warrior clothed in bearskin\" (see¬†[bear](https://www.etymonline.com/word/bear?ref=etymonline_crossreference#etymonline_v_8204 \"Etymology, meaning and definition of bear\")¬†(n.) +¬†[sark](https://www.etymonline.com/word/sark?ref=etymonline_crossreference \"Etymology, meaning and definition of sark\")). Thus not, as Scott evidently believed, from Old Norse¬†berr¬†\"bare, naked\" and meaning \"warrior who fights without armor.\"\n\n- **Nightmare (n.):**\n  c. 1300, \"an evil female spirit afflicting men (or horses) in their sleep with a feeling of suffocation,\" compounded from¬†[night](https://www.etymonline.com/word/night?ref=etymonline_crossreference \"Etymology, meaning and definition of night\")¬†+¬†[mare](https://www.etymonline.com/word/mare?ref=etymonline_crossreference#etymonline_v_43707 \"Etymology, meaning and definition of mare\")¬†(n.3) \"goblin that causes nightmares, incubus.\" The meaning shifted mid-16c. from the incubus to the suffocating sensation it causes. Sense of \"any bad dream\" is recorded by 1829; that of \"very distressing experience\" is from 1831.\n\n- **Quarantine (n.):**\n  1660s, \"period a ship suspected of carrying contagious disease is kept in isolation,\" from Italian¬†quaranta giorni, literally \"space of forty days,\" from¬†quaranta¬†\"forty,\" from Latin¬†quadraginta\"forty\" (related to¬†quattuor¬†\"four,\" from PIE root¬†[\\*kwetwer-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*kwetwer-?ref=etymonline_crossreference \"Etymology, meaning and definition of *kwetwer-\")¬†\"four\").\n  \n  The name is from the Venetian policy (first enforced in 1377) of keeping ships from plague-stricken countries waiting off its port for 40 days to assure that no latent cases were aboard. The extended sense of \"any period of forced isolation\" is from 1670s.\n\n- **Clue (n.):**\n  \"anything that guides or directs in an intricate case,\" 1590s, a special use of a revised spelling of¬†[clew](https://www.etymonline.com/word/clew?ref=etymonline_crossreference \"Etymology, meaning and definition of clew\")¬†\"a ball of thread or yarn\" (q.v.). The word, which is native Germanic, in Middle English was¬†clewe, also¬†cleue; some words borrowed from Old French in -ue, -eu¬†also were spelled¬†-ew¬†in Middle English, such as¬†blew, imbew,¬†but these later were reformed to¬†-ue, and this process was extended to native words (hue, true, clue) which had ended in a vowel and¬†-w. The spelling¬†clue¬†is first attested mid-15c.\n  \n  The sense shift is originally in reference to the clew of thread given by Ariadne to Theseus to use as a guide out of the Labyrinth in Greek mythology. The purely figurative sense of \"that which points the way,\" without regard to labyrinths, is from 1620s. As something which a bewildered person does not have, by 1948.\n\n- **Euphemism (n.):**\n  1650s, from Greek¬†euphemismos¬†\"use of a favorable word in place of an inauspicious one, superstitious avoidance of words of ill-omen during religious ceremonies,\" also of substitutions such as¬†[Eumenides](https://www.etymonline.com/word/Eumenides?ref=etymonline_crossreference \"Etymology, meaning and definition of Eumenides\")¬†for the Furies. This is from¬†euphemizein¬†\"speak with fair words, use words of good omen,\" from¬†eu-¬†\"good, well\" (see¬†[eu-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/eu-?ref=etymonline_crossreference \"Etymology, meaning and definition of eu-\")) +¬†phƒìmƒì¬†\"speech, voice, utterance, a speaking,\" from¬†phanai¬†\"speak\" (from PIE root¬†[\\*bha-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*bha-?ref=etymonline_crossreference#etymonline_v_52548 \"Etymology, meaning and definition of *bha-\")¬†(2) \"to speak, tell, say\"). See also¬†[Euxine](https://www.etymonline.com/word/Euxine?ref=etymonline_crossreference \"Etymology, meaning and definition of Euxine\"), and compare Greek Greek¬†aristeros¬†\"the better one,\" a euphemism for \"the left (hand).\" In English, a rhetorical term at first; broader sense of \"choosing a less distasteful word or phrase than the one meant\" is first attested 1793.\n\n- **Emergency (n.):**\n  \"unforeseen occurrence requiring immediate attention,\" 1630s, from Latin¬†emergens, present participle of¬†emergere¬†\"to rise out or up\" (see¬†[emerge](https://www.etymonline.com/word/emerge?ref=etymonline_crossreference \"Etymology, meaning and definition of emerge\")). Or from¬†emerge¬†+¬†-ency. As an adjective by 1881.\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T01:20:16.644597831Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/Subsystems/Phonetics-Phonology":{"title":"Phonetics \u0026 Phonology","content":"#englang #subsystem\n\n## Phonetics\nPhonetics is the study of human speech sounds, how they're produced, transmitted and received. Phonetic transcription focuses on the precise way in which a sound is produced by a particular speaker on a particular occasion, but is not related to any particular language.\n\n- We refer to individual sounds as phones or sounds, never letters\n- There are two kinds of transcriptions using the IPA; broad and narrow\n- All broad (general or phonemic) transcriptions is done with phonetic slashes /si/\n- All narrow (phonetic) transcription is done within phonetic brackets:¬† \\[si]\n\n\u003e Questions:\n\nWhat is phonetics the study of? :: Phonetics is the study of human speech sounds, how they're produced, transmitted and received. ^1677146865711\n\nWhat are the two kinds of transcriptions using the IPA? :: There are two kinds of transcriptions using the IPA; broad and narrow. ^1677146865717\n\n### Fields\n#### Articulatory Phonetics\nHow sounds are produced\n#### Acoustic Phonetics\nPhysical properties of sounds\n#### Auditory Phonetics\nHow sounds are perceived\n\n### Transcription\nTranscription aims to create a system of one-to-one sound-symbol correspondence, which is not necessarily the case with spelling.\n\nExamples of transcription:\n- Next: /n…õkst/\n- Chin: /t É…™n/‚Å† \n- Lamb: /l√¶m/ \n- Kite: /ka…™t/\n- Cat: /k√¶t/\n- Meet: /miÀêt/\n\nA rough-coated, dough-faced, thoughtful ploughman strode through the streets of Scarborough.¬† After falling into a slough, coughed and hiccoughed.\n\n/…ô …πuf-k…ô äted, d…ô ä-fe…™sd, Œ∏…îÀêtf äl pla äm…òn str…µ äd Œ∏ruÀê √∞…ô striÀêts …íf sk…ëÀêbr…ô. …ëÀêft…ô f…îÀêl…™≈ã …™ntuÀê …ô sla ä, k…ëft and h…™k åpt/\n\n### The International Phonetic Alphabet\nThe IPA is an international alphabet that can transcribe any of the world's languages.\n- In IPA transcription, one phone (IPA symbol) usually equals one sounds\n\n### Allophones\nWhat is an allophone? :: Allophones are more specific interpretations of a phoneme, made for narrow transcriptions.  ^1677146865719\n![[notes/School Subjects/English Language/Subsystems/Diagrams/Allophone Diagram.png]]\n\n### Place + Manner\n#### **Place** of Articulation\n**Where** the sound is made\n![[notes/School Subjects/English Language/Subsystems/Diagrams/Human Mouth Diagram.png]]\n##### Consonants\n![[notes/School Subjects/English Language/Subsystems/Diagrams/Consonant IPA Table.png]]\nThe top is the place and the and the left is the manner\n##### Vowels\n![[notes/School Subjects/English Language/Subsystems/Diagrams/Vowel IPA Table.png]]\n#### **Manner** of Articulation\n**How** the sound is made\n\n## Phonology\nPhonology is the study of the sound system of a specific language. The sounds of the English language for instance are very different to the sounds of Italian or Mandarin, and the sounds of Australian English differ from those of American English.\n- How many sounds in Australian English? :: 44 phonemes ^1677146865721\n- Each language has different sounds and stresses particular phonemes, and can completely change the meaning of the word (*pro*ject vs pro*ject*)\n\n### Connected Speech\nThere are no actual gaps in between words in speech generally, only written. \n#### Elision #card\nWhat is elision? :: The omission (deletion) of a sound in connected speech (**sounds are lost**) - this sound may be a vowel, a consonant or even a whole syllable. For instance 'cos instead of pronouncing because. We often **elide** sounds in rapid, everyday speech purely for ease of pronunciation. Another example would be 'want to' vs wanna ^1677146865722\n#### Vowel Reduction #card\nWhat is vowel reduction? :: Similar to elision but, instead of disappearing completely, vowels in unstressed positions are reduced to schwa /…ô/. So the word 'to' /tu/ might be reduced to /t…ô/ ^1677146865723\n#### Assimilation #card\nWhat is assimilation? :: When a **sound changes** to become more like a neighbouring sound. Assimilation may be *progressive* where the sound is affected by a preceding sounds, or *regressive* (also known as *anticipatory assimilation*), where the following sound is affected by a following sound.  ^1677146865724\n##### Examples\nProgressive:\n- talked becomes /t…îÀêkt/\n- pens become /penz/\nRegressive:\n- light blue /laip bluÀê/\n- green boat becomes /griÀêm b…ô ät/\n\n#### Insertion #card\nWhat is insertion? :: There are two examples of **sounds being added**, generally deliberately. The first is insertion, the other is epenthesis. **Insertion doesn't add a full syllable, whereas epenthesis does** ^1677146865725\n- a voiceless stop insertion where, between a nasal consonant and a voiceless fricative, a voiceless stop with the same place of articulation as the nasal consonant is inserted.\n\t- e.g. In English, many add a /p/ to hamster and say \"hampster\"/\n- after a nasal consonant, a voiceless stop may be 'added\n\t- e.g. In English, many add a /k/ to something which becomes /s åmŒ∏…™≈ãk/\n##### Epenthesis\nWhat is epenthesis? :: Epenthesis is the insertion of an extra sound into a word. **Epenthesis adds a full extra syllable** ^1677146865726\n- Involves the addition of sounds (syllables) where they don't strictly belong. For instance, it's common for people to insert a vowel in 'souvlaki' so that it sounds like 'souv-e-laki'. And humbling sometimes becomes humb-e-ling.\n##### Intrusion\nWhat is intrusion? :: This is where sounds are added between words but is not deliberate, but may be put together as insertion. ^1677146865728\n\nWhen two vowel sounds meet, we tend to insert an extra sound which resembles wither a /j/, /w/ or /r/, to mark the transition sound between the two vowels, a device referred to as intrusion.\n- Consonants can also be added, for instance Australians often add r in law and order so that it sounds more like \"lor an order\".\n#### Metathesis #card\nWhat is metathesis? :: Metathesis sounds complicated but it's a very common aspect of the English language. It is the transposition within a word of its sounds. The word \"metathesis\" comes from the Greek word meaning to transpose. It's also known as a permutation. ^1677146865729\n- Ask becomes /arks/\n- Nuclear becomes /nuc…ôl…ôer/\n### Prosodic Features #card\nAffect **how** we say something\n- Volume is the modulation of volume in your voice, which is used to convey emotions\n- Tempo is the speed and which we speak, reasons for speaking faster or slower\n- Intonation is the pattern of pitch changes in speech, it is the variation of spoken pitch used in language. It can be used to\n\t- Indicate the different attitudes and emotions of the speaker\n\t- Signal the difference between statements, questions.\n- Stress is the degree of strength used to pronounce a syllable\n^1677146865730\n\nNon-verbal features do not affect the features of speech, while paralinguistic features (cough, laugh, breath, aka vocal effects) do impact my speech, meaning you can still hear them. \n\n### Phonological Patterning #card\n- Alliteration: seven slippery snakes\n- Assonance: he claps his hands and puts them in the sand\n- Consonance: Mike likes his new bike\n- Onomatopoeia: boom, crash, brrrrrr\n- Rhythm: I'm going down like a bottle of whiskey\n- Rhyme: The cat and the hat, sat on a mat\n^1677146865731\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T01:20:16.644597831Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/Subsystems/Semantics":{"title":"Semantics","content":"#englang #subsystem \n## Vocabulary\n### Synonyms/Antonyms\nSynonyms have the same or similar definit\n\n## Semantic Change\n| Process                    | Example         |\n| -------------------------- | --------------- |\n| Shift                      | Mouse           |\n| Narrowing                  | Computer        |\n| Broadening                 | Bird            |\n| Elevation/Amelioration (+ve meaning)    | Fan             |\n| Degeneration/Pejoration (-ve meaning) | Knave/Emergency |\n| Eponyms                    | Elevator        |\n| Metaphor                   | Leg/Tongue      |\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T01:20:16.644597831Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/Subsystems/Syntax":{"title":"Syntax","content":"#englang #subsystem \n\nSyntax refers to sentence \u003cu\u003estructure\u003c/u\u003e, whereas the sentence types refers to semantics.\nThis means it studies the parts of a sentence, and how information s organised within speech or writing.\n\n- Every sentence contains a subject and a predicate\n- The subject refers to what or who is doing the action within the sentence.

Nonetheless, our nations are built on a notion of democracy that is flawed without this freedom, the ability to be able to articulate opinions and thoughts without the fear of being censored or face legal consequences. Time and time again, this right has been used to defend hate speech, and though freedom of speech definitely gives people the right to use hate speech, as it always has done, this does not mean people are exempt from any form of retaliation.\n\nVery frequently when people say that their freedom of speech is being violated, what they actually mean is that they are upset that people do not agree with them. In no way has anyone physically stopped them from saying ludicrous or hateful things, they have just faced retaliation for the harmful messages they are spreading. Such petty individuals seemingly miss the point of the concept: they are allowed to say what they want and let people listen, but what people do when they hear the message is up to the people and the people alone.\n\nIn some extreme cases, hate speech *will* be removed, or in other words, the opinion of the speaker is being censored. This in most cases can be seen as a consequence of the impact of the message, not the idea the message carries itself. Once again, they have fully been able to voice their opinion, and it is not being silenced by some tyrannical regime, but has rather been removed due to active harm that is being caused to others. Does it not make sense that if a message online is hypothetically teaching children how to make explosives that cause property damage, it would be removed and erased? This is simply correct not because it is censoring a message of being able to defend yourself, but because it is hurting landowners and the kids it influences. There is always a line, and though the edges near that line can be blurry, someone has to be able to apply moral judgement to the outcome of messages as to prevent easily preventable actions.\n\nIn conclusion, freedom of speech is a wonderful right that should apply to us all, including allowing the use of any kind of speech. This being said, hate speech can and will be removed from certain platforms if it is actively causing harm, an image the platforms would not like to convey, and people are welcome to find other ways to express their opinions. People disagreeing with an opinion is clearly not a violation of your freedom of speech, as encouraged discourse is the whole idea behind the concept, and people of all ages should be free to form their own opinions with all information available to them.","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T01:20:16.644597831Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/Transition-Period/Interesting-English-Language-Articles":{"title":"Interesting English Language Articles","content":"\n#englang #research\n1. The Scots Language\n\tThis is a really interesting article I found through [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP-PV9ryXM4) by xidnaf, and it talked about when a language actually becomes a different language. The line seems to be *really* blurry surprisingly.\n\t\n\tThe video mentions that linguists actually split languages by mutual intelligibility, so if people can understand each other even though some words are different or dialects/accents are different, the language is the same.\n\t\n\tThis still has its own problems though, because for example the Chinese \"languages\" are referred to as dialects even though they can't exactly understand each other, but they still use the same writing system, so you're in the weird position of they speak different languages, but they write in the same one ¬Ø\\\\\\_(„ÉÑ)\\_/¬Ø\n\t\n\tDialect Continuums are also a thing which is cool, overall there's just quite a big range. Australian people might struggle to understand British people, not a different language, but could still maybe understand a *few* loan words in Arabic or such, and the range varies such as English with German etc.\n\t\n\tIt's also not symmetrical e.g. people from Denmark can understand people from Sweden a lot better than vice versa.\n\t\n\tAll in all, what even is a different language is basically up to what we call it, and in the end it's basically all politics funnily enough.\n\t\n\tAnd now we get the Scots Language! It split from Old English similar to modern English, which was spoken about 1000 years ago in Britain. This is completely seperate to Scottish mind you, but is rather a remnant of what Old English was like.\n\t\n\tHere's a demonstration of the Scot's Language which can be found [here](https://youtu.be/cENbkHS3mnY) and helped demonstrate the concept of mutual intelligibility, which is quite common in other places but not so much for native English speakers\n\t \n\thttps://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/scots-language\n\n2.

Unlike animals that need a stimulus such a biscuit or a treat to be forced to speak, humans speak by themselves and start conversations themselves.\n### Displacement\nHumans also have the ability to talk about things that are not in the present moment. This means that they can talk about something that happened lats week, or something that is happening somewhere else right now. This is similar to object perminance, having the ability to communicate beyond the here and now.\n\n## Arbitrariness\nIn general, human language is quite arbitrary. There is nothing about language that neccessarily symbolises something. There is nothing about the sound \"tree\" that links to the thing outside which is brown and green; it is all random. Though there are exceptions, the most common of which being onomatopoeic words such as *whoosh*, *slurp*, *pop* and so on, most words in general are arbitrary.\n\n## Structure and Creativity\nHuman language is an open system that can be added to and combined and recombined in many ways to create new forms. Random units of sound which don't have meaning in of themselves combine to form meaningful morphemes or words. Animals generally don't have this ability, where one sound means one action, and cannot be split up into individual pieces to be reconstructed. Male grasshoppers have the ability to say one of 6 messgages; humans have the ability to talk about literally anything we want. We can even talk about things that don't exist!\n\n## Cultural Transmission\nHuman language depends on cultural transmission. It is not genetic and instinctual like a dog barking, who will bark the same wherever they go, but is rather learnt from the environment. A cantonese born child growing up in an English speaking house will speak English, it is not something defined inherantly but by the people around the child. Similarly, a bird isolated from any contact will still sing songs, but humans isolated from any society will not be able to speak any languages until they start learning from contact with people around them.","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T01:20:16.704598928Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/What-is-a-Language/Key-Terms":{"title":"Key Terms","content":"#englang \n\n## Dialectal Variation #card \nVariation associated with the language of a particular locality, region or geographical area.\n^1678180892654\n\n## Flipping #card \nTerm used to suggest rapid semantic change in a word from its original meaning to its opposite (or near opposite).\n^1678180892684\n\n## Orthographical Variation #card \nHow the use of symbols, letters and spellings varies among language users.\n^1678180892687\n\n## Phonological Variation #card \nHow the sounds of a language vary among different speakers (accent)\n^1678180892690\n\n## Semantic Variation #card \nHow word (and phrase) meanings vary from place to place and group to group\n^1678180892693\n\n## Social Variation #card \nVariation associated with a particular social group i.e., social class or educational background.\n^1678180892696\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T01:20:16.704598928Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/What-is-a-Language/Variables-of-Communication":{"title":"Variables of Communication","content":"#englang #notes\n\nIn [[notes/School Subjects/English Language/English Language|English Language]] Units 1 - 4 we will be using these variables to annotate texts:\n## Mode\nThe medium of communication\n- **Written**\n- **Spoken**\n- **Sign**\n## Register\nFormality and respect level, the way a person speaks in respect to their audience\n- **Intimate**: people you know really well, close\n- **Casual**: the way we speak every day to one another, varies from more formal to less in of itself\n- **Consultative**: where there is an uneven power relationship, i.e. doctor patient, student teacher\n- **Formal**: one way, so a speech or letter. maybe meeting the queen lol\n- **Frozen**: things that don't change, such a marriage ceremony, beginning of a sermon, starting of a high court, welcome to country\n## Context\nEstablished background/circumstance, situation surrounding text\n- Situational\n- Cultural\n- Historical\n## Audience\nThe demographic that your are speaking to\n## Function\nPurpose of communication, what we are hoping to gain\n- What is the text set out to do\n- Social purpose, e.g. building rapport, encouraging group membership\n## Field\nHow specialised the communication is, area of interest + subject area\n## Setting\nWhere the communication is taking place\n\n\u003cmark style=\"background: #F9C74F;\"\u003e# MR CAFS\u003c/mark\u003e","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T01:20:16.704598928Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/What-is-a-Language/What-is-a-Language":{"title":"What is a Language?","content":"\n#englang #research \n## Definition 1\n### Source: [Language Meaning \u0026 Concept | What is Language? - Video \u0026 Lesson Transcript | Study.com](https://study.com/learn/lesson/language-meaning-concept.html)\n### Definition:\nEssentially, language is a term for any complex communication system used by humans that consists of words and phrases that, when combined, can create infinite variable utterances. How humans initially developed language is not wholly clear and is something that linguists are still researching. Most humans learn at least one language in early childhood.

In other words, new symbols can be freely added to the system. For example, if I say that I define \"vlirsnik\" to mean \"the feeling of learning something new\" I can add it to this system of communication we are using right now and you will be able to understand it. Therefore, this is a language.\n\n---\n## What is common to your three definitions?\nAll three of the definitions mention that languages are a communication system, that try to express thoughts, ideas and feelings. They also mention that they have a common set of conventions that allow for a practically infinite set of meanings to be added.\n\n---\n## In your own words explain the word \"language\"\nA language is a set of communication standards that aim to convey meaning in the form of ideas, concepts, thoughts and feelings. This is done in a way that ideas can be added to these said conventions to be able to convey new concepts that were previously not expressible, therefore being modular in its usage.","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T01:20:16.704598928Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/Literature":{"title":"Literature","content":"\n#lit #subject \n## Unit 1\n### AoS 1: The Penelopiad\n- Read an extract from [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/A Thousand Ships Extract|A Thousand Ships]] and annotate, and then compare and contrast it with [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Calliope and the Painting|a painting]]\n- Read [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Chapters/Chapter 1|Chapter 1]] of The Penelopiad and write about how [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Atwood|Atwood]] comments on [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Culture \u0026 Society- The Penelopiad|Culture and Society]]\n- Write a short 200 word essay on a quote from [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Chapters/Chapter 6|Chapter 6]]\n- Write about the maids' [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Cold Eyed Teenaged Killer|cold eyed teenaged killer]], Telemachus\n- Write a [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/The Obstacle To Go Through|creative piece]] on Chapter 6\n- Do a close passage analysis on [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/The Birth of Telemachus Close Analysis|the birth of Telemachus]]\n- Comment on [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Relationships|relationships]] in Chapter 12\n- Comment on [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Penelope as a Narrator|Penelope as a narrator]] in Chapter 15\n- Explore the significance of a passage from Chapter 18, [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/News Of Helen|News of Helen]]\n- Explore [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Chapters/Chapter 24|Chapter 24]] and what it says about the eyes of the beholder\n- What is the significance of [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Truth and Storytelling|Truth and Storytelling]] in the novel.\n- [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/What is The Penelopiad About?|What is The Penelopiad even about?]]\n- Analyse the quote, [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/In Death I Know Everything|\"Now that I am dead I know everything.\"]]","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T01:20:16.704598928Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/A-Thousand-Ships-Extract":{"title":"A Thousand Ships Extract","content":"#lit #flashwrite \n\n\u003e Comment on the author's use of tone and voice of the character Calliope in this extract.\n\nThe author makes Calliope's voice quite direct, using a lot of short clauses which comment on her own emotions and the state of the world around her.

Penelope's mother is well versed in this world of hardships that cannot be expressed on her face, having to be dealt with behind a facade, so she advises her child to do the same: to use her smarts to outwit the challenge of marriage that comes her way, and to try and live happily despite the unideal scenario the world places her in against her own will.","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T01:20:16.704598928Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/Cold-Eyed-Teenaged-Killer":{"title":"Cold Eyed Teenaged Killer","content":"#lit #flashwrite \n\n\u003e [!question] \n\u003e \n\u003e How and why does Atwood compare the maids and their \"cold eyed teenaged killer\", Telemachus? 200 words\n\nAtwood makes the comparison between Telemachus and the maids, highlighting parallels, stating that they were \"infants when he was an infant, wailing just as he wailed, helpless as he was helpless, but ten times more helpless as well\".

The extract makes it evident that Telemachus has no sense of consequences, where he was saved \"more by good luck than good planning\", showing how those with power born into high status can so often disregard the outcomes of their actions. \n\nThe passage is crucial to understanding Telemachus' views and inherent entitlement to power, and whenever the patriarchy is defied in any way, such as Penelope doing ‚Äúwhat was usually considered a man‚Äôs business‚Äù, he gets \"irritated by it\" expressing that he needs to \"\\[get] out from under the thumbs of the women\".  Atwood uses this idea to further push and reinforce the idea that children are a product of society's values and flaws, and there was no difference between the maids and Telemachus at birth, only the way that the world treated them. It also furthers our understanding of gender roles within the novel, where once again Penelope is stripped from her individual identity, being referred to as \"the women\", where her gender defines her even to her own son.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T01:20:16.704598928Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/Odyssey":{"title":"Odyssey","content":"#lit #book\n\nThe Odyssey is a tale by Homer about the epic adventures of the Greek king Odysseus.

Why do you think she chooses to present Penelope's character in this way?¬† Use evidence from chapter 15, The Shroud, to support your point of view.\n\nThroughout Chapter 15, we get a glimpse as to why Penelope may not be the most reliable of narrators throughout the novel. In general, the recount of the events in the story are quite opinionated, clouded by a judgement from one side and experience, and as such there can never be one \"truth\" because all experiences will be under some lens or the other.\n\nWe keenly get this idea when Penelope speaks of the maids, who are supposedly her children whom for she cares a lot. Despite this, she still allows for horrid things to happen to them such as being raped by the suitors, occurrences that she describes as almost inevitable with no remorse or sympathy. Further, she describes them as her \"eyes and ears around the castle\", pawns that she uses for her own individual purposes to their detriment. Nonetheless, the story is portrayed from the perspective of Penelope, meaning that all of these flaws of her character are obfuscated behind the lens of her narration.","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T01:20:16.704598928Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/Relationships":{"title":"Relationships","content":"#flashwrite #lit #analysis \n\n\u003e [!info]\n\u003e \n\u003e Comment on the theme of relationships as reflected in chapter xii, Waiting\n\nRelationships in Chapter 12, Waiting, are viewed almost as transactional with defined purposes in a very cold and non-compassionate manner. Atwood uses the chapter to express the idea that women are so often left behind and discarded in relationships, with Odysseus just leaving with not much more than a word, causing everything to blur into one monotonous cycle. All she did was wait for news in of Odysseus, further pushing the idea that her only worth is in relation to him.\n\nThe chapter also explores the idea that men have no consequences for their actions, and that anything they do will be glorified and portrayed as a wonderful tale, whereas the women's actions will never be credited to them, simply given to the man who did nothing. Atwood describes a Penelope who dreams of a day, \"Odysseus returning and \\[her] - with womanly modesty - revealing to him how well \\[she] had done at what was usually considered a man's business. On his behalf, of course\". It all had to be on his behalf, because within the text women have no voice at all or any individuality when removed for their male counterpart. Unlike Penelope, Odysseus could do anything, flirt with anyone, even Helen who \"had bathed him and anointed him with her very own hands\" and there were meant to be no consequences, because he can do whatever he pleases.\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T01:20:16.704598928Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/The-Birth-of-Telemachus-Close-Analysis":{"title":"The Birth of Telemachus Close Analysis","content":"#lit #flashwrite #analysis\n\n\u003e [!info] \n\u003e \n\u003e Comment on how the passage illustrates the theme of power and powerlessness\n\nThroughout the passage, Atwood uses the motif of water and ocean to represent the power dynamic of the world she has built. The ones who hold the power, Telemachus, Odysseus, the Gods, all use water as a medium to enact their will. Telemachus' birth was not just a birth, it was a \"nine-month voyage\" to be celebrated, as was the great tale of Odysseus who travelled the many seas with great feats. At the same time, Atwood uses the metaphor of water to show how helpless those without power can be. The same power of the ocean just spat the maid out, \"beached at the same time he was\". They were simply spat out, discarded and sub-human, with words such as spawned and appeared describing their inherent inhumanity.\n\nAtwood also uses a combination of anaphora and juxtaposition to directly compare Telemachus and the maids. \"**Infants** when he was an **infant**, **wailing** just as he **wailed**,\" a repetition of the same words to emphasise the point that they apply to directly both the maids and Telemachus. At the same time, the enjambment of lines such as \"wailing just\" and \"as he wailed\" makes the reading more uncomfortable, expressing the idea that though they are identical in almost every way, the wail of a prince is still not equal to the wail of a servant girl. \n\nAtwood uses this mechanism to comment on an important aspect of our modern society: all children are born the same and equal, but it is society's ideals that create imbalance. The environment around Telemachus, not Telemachus himself, is what caused his wail to be any different from the others, and when he grows up being told he is entitled to a kingdom and the lives of those within it, he thus believes so, evident by Penelope's description in Chapter 15, that ‚Äú\\[Telemachus] was starting to look at \\[her] in an odd way, holding \\[her] responsible for the fact that his inheritance was being literally gobbled up.‚Äù \n\nThe excessive use of pronouns in this passage also creates the effect of dehumanising everyone involved. The maids, as always are referred to as a collective, but Telemachus is also never referred to by name, rather as a mysterious \"he\". This lack of definitive character portrays Telemachus as someone who is much more sinister than otherwise, an amalgamation and representation of the power imbalance in their world, causing him to be the antagonist in this poem. The repetitive use of short quick phrases and many verbs also gives the reader a sense that the maids are *objects* built for doing things with, further commenting on the humanity of this conglomeration of broken, unwanted children.","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T01:20:16.704598928Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/The-Obstacle-To-Go-Through":{"title":"The Obstacle To Go Through","content":"#lit #thepenelopiad #flashwrite \n\n\u003e [!quote]\n\u003e \n\u003e \"It's hope, and hope only, that keeps us afloat.\" (Chapter 7 The Chorus Line: If I Was a Princess, A Popular Tune)\n\n**Water**, crashing against the hull of our fate as we hurl further and further into the ocean's **waves**.

Oh how I wish I had the hope she did.*\n\n*This nameless girl, the girl of hopes and dreams, she frolicked around the paddocks and fields, until one day she met a man.

In the Anthropology Lecture, the maids deeply interpret their own lives as legend, a chapter that may initially be viewed as reaching for meaning, but as the maids address, is as valid as any other myth in Ancient Greek mythology. Men place such deep value on their lives, over interpreting the mundane and making that their own truth. Each Chorus Line chapter is a different rendition of this truth, told in a great variety of mediums from many different stories and perspectives, highlighting a key idea that Atwood tries to express: the truth is what we make it.

In countless retellings and recounts, what is considered to be true or the relevance of a truth even mattering is warped and moulded, recontextualised to be timeless and universal. Such is demonstrated by Margaret Atwood's 2005 novel \u003cu\u003eThe Penelopiad\u003c/u\u003e, which retells and appropriated Homer's epic, \u003cu\u003eThe Odyssey\u003c/u\u003e from the perspective of Penelope, an otherwise overshadowed character. Atwood reshapes the narrative to reflect contemporary contexts and values, and tells a story that is pertinent to our society. \u003cu\u003eThe Penelopiad\u003c/u\u003e is a book about truth and power, and how those who have the voice and power are the ones that decide what is true, holding the lives of other in the palm of their hand.\n\nOne of the main themes of the book is truth: who the story is told by. Penelope states that \"many people have believed that \\[Odysseus's] version of events was the true one\", so to set the record straight \"\\[she'll] spin a thread of \\[her] own\". Atwood brings up the idea, time and time again, that people with power (in most cases men) are the ones who have the ability to dictate what is true and what is not. Odysseus made up any fictitious remark about himself, deeply interpreting his own life, yet his account was taken as meaningful due to his reputation and position. This theme permeates the novel from the beginning to end, Penelope never getting a chance to tell her story while she was alive, and the maids still voiceless in death, all of which are structured in a power hierarchy that ruthlessly rips agency away from those born less notable. \n\nOn the counter-side to this, the novel is filled with deceit and lies. The same quote from above sees Penelope mention how \"\\[Odysseus] was always so plausible ... even I believed him from time to time\". Atwood wonders how Odysseus, actively known for his trickery and lies, still holds academic merit. She is haunted by these lies, where anyone with power can spin up their own tale and retell other people's truth, enacting it into reality. From the moment they meet, Penelope comments that ‚Äúthe way Odysseus told the story made me suspect there was more to it‚Äù, and this follows for the rest of her marriage, where she states ‚Äúthe two of us were...proficient and shameless liars of long standing. It was a wonder either of us believed a word the other said. But we did. Or so we told each other‚Äù.\n\nOverall, Atwood tells a story of how power is truth, more these days than ever. By recontextualising a novel told from the male perspective about glorified events embedded in myth, Atwood is able to use \u003cu\u003eThe Penelopiad\u003c/u\u003e as a means of touching on important societal issues such as sexism, wealth inequality and power imbalance, all through a unique but subtle novel that leaves the reader wondering one question: what was actually true?\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T01:20:16.704598928Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Physics/Logbook/13-2-2023":{"title":"13-2-2023","content":"#physics #prac\n\n![[notes/School Subjects/Physics/Logbook/Refraction/Refraction with Pyrex.pdf]]\n\nAlso put data into an excel worksheet that you can find [[notes/School Subjects/Physics/Logbook/Refraction/I_R_Snells law prac_20231.xlsx|here]], along with some questions from a word document [[notes/School Subjects/Physics/Logbook/Refraction/CGS Refraction of light prac 2023.docx|here]]","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T01:20:16.704598928Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Physics/Logbook/30-11-2022":{"title":"30-11-2022","content":"#physics #waves #prac\n\nDid a prac with slinkies to explore longitudinal and transverse waves\n![[notes/School Subjects/Physics/Logbook/Waves/Waves Worksheet.pdf]]","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T01:20:16.704598928Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Physics/Logbook/Logbook":{"title":"Logbook","content":"\n#physics\n# [[notes/School Subjects/Physics/Logbook/30-11-2022|30-11-2022]]\n30th November 2022: Waves Practical with Slinkies\n\n# [[notes/School Subjects/Physics/Logbook/13-2-2023|13-2-2023]]\n13th February 2023: Refraction of Light with Snell's Law \n","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T01:20:16.704598928Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Physics/Physics":{"title":"Physics","content":"#physics #subject\n\nYou can also view my [[notes/School Subjects/Physics/Logbook/Logbook|Logbook]] which is a log of all practicals\n## Unit 1\n- Week 1: Waves\n\t- [[notes/School Subjects/Physics/Waves/Wave Definitions|Wave Definitions]] for the parts of a wave\n\t- [[notes/School Subjects/Physics/WCCC/WCCC 1|WCCC 1]]: a weekly quiz handout to check our stage of learning\n- Week 3: Refraction\n\t- Snell's Law, etc\n\t- [[notes/School Subjects/Physics/WCCC/WCCC 3|WCCC 3]]: Weekly Quiz, this time of refraction!\n- Week 4: Thermodynamics\n\t- [[notes/School Subjects/Physics/WCCC/WCCC 4|WCCC 4]] on heat and temperature!\n\t- [[notes/School Subjects/Physics/Thermodynamics/Laws of Thermodynamics|Laws of Thermodynamics]]\n- Week 5: Thermal Radiation\n\t- [[notes/School Subjects/Physics/Thermodynamics/Wien's Law|Wien's Law]]","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T01:20:16.708599001Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Physics/Thermodynamics/Laws-of-Thermodynamics":{"title":"Laws of Thermodynamics","content":"#physics #thermodynamics\n\n\u003e [!info]\n\u003e \n\u003e What is heat?
