Nonetheless, our nations are built on a notion of democracy that is flawed without this freedom, the ability to be able to articulate opinions and thoughts without the fear of being censored or face legal consequences. Time and time again, this right has been used to defend hate speech, and though freedom of speech definitely gives people the right to use hate speech, as it always has done, this does not mean people are exempt from any form of retaliation.\n\nVery frequently when people say that their freedom of speech is being violated, what they actually mean is that they are upset that people do not agree with them. In no way has anyone physically stopped them from saying ludicrous or hateful things, they have just faced retaliation for the harmful messages they are spreading. Such petty individuals seemingly miss the point of the concept: they are allowed to say what they want and let people listen, but what people do when they hear the message is up to the people and the people alone.\n\nIn some extreme cases, hate speech *will* be removed, or in other words, the opinion of the speaker is being censored. This in most cases can be seen as a consequence of the impact of the message, not the idea the message carries itself. Once again, they have fully been able to voice their opinion, and it is not being silenced by some tyrannical regime, but has rather been removed due to active harm that is being caused to others. Does it not make sense that if a message online is hypothetically teaching children how to make explosives that cause property damage, it would be removed and erased? This is simply correct not because it is censoring a message of being able to defend yourself, but because it is hurting landowners and the kids it influences. There is always a line, and though the edges near that line can be blurry, someone has to be able to apply moral judgement to the outcome of messages as to prevent easily preventable actions.\n\nIn conclusion, freedom of speech is a wonderful right that should apply to us all, including allowing the use of any kind of speech. This being said, hate speech can and will be removed from certain platforms if it is actively causing harm, an image the platforms would not like to convey, and people are welcome to find other ways to express their opinions. People disagreeing with an opinion is clearly not a violation of your freedom of speech, as encouraged discourse is the whole idea behind the concept, and people of all ages should be free to form their own opinions with all information available to them.","lastmodified":"2023-02-01T21:28:13.401070404Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/Transition-Period/Interesting-English-Language-Articles":{"title":"Interesting English Language Articles","content":"\n#englang #research\n1. The Scots Language\n\tThis is a really interesting article I found through [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP-PV9ryXM4) by xidnaf, and it talked about when a language actually becomes a different language. The line seems to be *really* blurry surprisingly.\n\t\n\tThe video mentions that linguists actually split languages by mutual intelligibility, so if people can understand each other even though some words are different or dialects/accents are different, the language is the same.\n\t\n\tThis still has its own problems though, because for example the Chinese \"languages\" are referred to as dialects even though they can't exactly understand each other, but they still use the same writing system, so you're in the weird position of they speak different languages, but they write in the same one ¬Ø\\\\\\_(„ÉÑ)\\_/¬Ø\n\t\n\tDialect Continuums are also a thing which is cool, overall there's just quite a big range. Australian people might struggle to understand British people, not a different language, but could still maybe understand a *few* loan words in Arabic or such, and the range varies such as English with German etc.\n\t\n\tIt's also not symmetrical e.g. people from Denmark can understand people from Sweden a lot better than vice versa.\n\t\n\tAll in all, what even is a different language is basically up to what we call it, and in the end it's basically all politics funnily enough.\n\t\n\tAnd now we get the Scots Language! It split from Old English similar to modern English, which was spoken about 1000 years ago in Britain. This is completely seperate to Scottish mind you, but is rather a remnant of what Old English was like.\n\t\n\tHere's a demonstration of the Scot's Language which can be found [here](https://youtu.be/cENbkHS3mnY) and helped demonstrate the concept of mutual intelligibility, which is quite common in other places but not so much for native English speakers\n\t \n\thttps://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/scots-language\n\n2.

How humans initially developed language is not wholly clear and is something that linguists are still researching. Most humans learn at least one language in early childhood. If a person lacks exposure to language as a young child, they will never be able to fluently learn a language as an adult because of how human brain development works.\n\n---\n# Definition 2\n## Source: [What is Language | IGI Global](https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/using-lean-method-in-english-language-classes/16613)\n## Definition:\nSystem for the expression of thoughts, feelings, etc., by the use of spoken sounds or convention symbols.\n\n---\n# Definition 3\n## Source: [what is language? : linguistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/bw37zc/what_is_language/)\n## Definition:\nA language is defined as a being an open system of communication. In other words, new symbols can be freely added to the system. For example, if I say that I define \"vlirsnik\" to mean \"the feeling of learning something new\" I can add it to this system of communication we are using right now and you will be able to understand it. Therefore, this is a language.\n\n---\n# What is common to your three definitions?\nAll three of the definitions mention that languages are a communication system, that try to express thoughts, ideas and feelings. They also mention that they have a common set of conventions that allow for a practically infinite set of meanings to be added.\n\n---\n# In your own words explain the word \"language\"\nA language is a set of communication standards that aim to convey meaning in the form of ideas, concepts, thoughts and feelings. This is done in a way that ideas can be added to these said conventions to be able to convey new concepts that were previously not expressible, therefore being modular in its usage.","lastmodified":"2023-02-01T21:28:13.461071256Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/Literature":{"title":"Literature","content":"\n#lit #subject \n## Unit 1\n### AoS 1: The Penelopiad\n- Read an extract from [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/A Thousand Ships Extract|A Thousand Ships]] and annotate, and then compare and contrast it with [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Calliope and the Painting|a painting]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-01T21:28:13.461071256Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/A-Thousand-Ships-Extract":{"title":"A Thousand Ships Extract","content":"\n#lit #flashwrite \n\n\u003e Comment on the author's use of tone and voice of the character Calliope in this extract.\n\nThe author makes Calliope's voice quite direct, using a lot of short clauses which comment on her own emotions and the state of the world around her. This observational tone combined with propositions such as, \"Perhaps he hasn't thought of what it is like to be me,\" allow the extract to form a clear image of how Calliope feels in the situation she describes: she is not understood and she is alone in her suffering. She questions her reality a lot, the need for it and the purpose behind it. Rhetorical questions such as, \"Can he really believe he has something new to say?\" or \"How much epic poetry does the world really need?\" all play into this narrative of it all being unnecessary, that none of it is required and is all built up on a greed for more fame and wealth and money, forgetting the true purpose behind any of in the first place.\n\nThe author also uses anaphora as a staple in Calliope's voice, utilising the repetition to highlight the monotony and \"foreverness\" of this situation. It is all a cycle, as evident by the end of the extract, and the character of Calliope embodies this, having experienced everything already. \"Every conflict joined, every war fought very city besieged, every town sacked, every village destroyed.\"","lastmodified":"2023-02-01T21:28:13.461071256Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/Calliope-and-the-Painting":{"title":"Calliope and the Painting","content":"\n#lit #flashwrite\nBoth the painting and Calliope both look very tired, like this has been going on for so long and they just want it to end. They are both also the subjects of painting, likely having to have sat as a model for so long, such a dull repetitive process that has completely drained them. They both are conventionally beautiful, dressed with riches and money, but there is a hollowness in their eyes, because none of it really means anything. Overall, she just seems tired and broken, because there is more to life than just the wealth and money that they are chasing, posing as an obedient wife character that will follow whatever the male lead says. The sense of dread permeates both the pieces, because they both would rather not be there.","lastmodified":"2023-02-01T21:28:13.461071256Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Physics/Logbook/30-11-2022":{"title":"30-11-2022","content":"\n#physics #waves \n\nDid a prac with slinkies to explore longitudinal and transverse waves\n![[Waves Worksheet.pdf]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-01T21:28:13.461071256Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Physics/Logbook/Logbook":{"title":"Logbook","content":"\n#physics\n# [[notes/School Subjects/Physics/Logbook/30-11-2022|30-11-2022]]\n30th November 2022: Waves Practical with Slinkies\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-01T21:28:13.461071256Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Physics/Physics":{"title":"Physics","content":"\n#physics #subject\nYou can also view my [[notes/School Subjects/Physics/Logbook/Logbook|Logbook]] which is a log of all practicals\n## Unit 1\n- Week 1: Waves\n\t- [[notes/School Subjects/Physics/Waves/Wave Definitions|Wave Definitions]] for the parts of a wave\n\t- [[notes/School Subjects/Physics/WCCC/WCCC 1|WCCC 1]]: a weekly quiz handout to check our stage of learning","lastmodified":"2023-02-01T21:28:13.461071256Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Physics/WCCC/WCCC-1":{"title":"WCCC 1","content":"\n#physics #wccc #waves \n1. Describe the motion of particles within a medium as a mechanical wave passes through the medium:\n   - The particles oscillate around a mean position, allowing for energy to be transferred through them without a net transfer of matter with zero displacement\n2. Which of the following statements are true and which are false? For the false statements, rewrite them so they become true.\n\t- **A**: ~~Longitudinal~~ Transverse waves occur when particles of the medium vibrate in the opposite direction to the direction of the wave: False, needs to be transverse\n\t- **B**: Transverse waves are created when the direction of vibration of the particles is at right angles to the direction of the wave: True\n\t- **C**: A longitudinal wave is able to travel through air: True\n\t- **D**: The vibrating string of a guitar is an example of a transverse wave: True\n3. The diagram below represents a slinky spring held at point A by a student.\n   \\[Insert Imaginary Diagram]\n   Draw an image of the pulse a short time after that shown in the diagram and determine the motion of point B.

A sound wave is emitted from a speaker and heard by Lee who is 50m from the speaker. He made several statements once he heard the sound. Which one or more of the following statements made by Lee would be correct? Explain your answers.\n\t- **A**: Hearing a sound wave tells me that air particles have travelled from the speaker to me.\n\t- **\u003cmark style=\"background: #FFF3A3A6;\"\u003eB\u003c/mark\u003e**: Air particles carried energy with them as they travelled from the speaker to me.\n\t- **\u003cmark style=\"background: #FFF3A3A6;\"\u003eC\u003c/mark\u003e**: Energy has been transferred from the speaker to me.\n\t- **\u003cmark style=\"background: #FFF3A3A6;\"\u003eD\u003c/mark\u003e**: Energy has been transferred from the speaker to me by the oscillation of air particles.\n\t- Explanation: The particles do not have a net transfer of matter but do transfer energy from the speaker to Lee\n7. A mechanical wave may be described as transverse or longitudinal. In a transverse wave, how does the motion of the particles compare with the direction of travel of the wave?\n   - In a transverse wave, the motion of the particles is perpendicular to the direction of the wave \n8. Classify the waves described below as either longitudinal or transverse:\n\t- **A**: sound waves - longitudinal\n\t- **B**: a vibrating guitar string - transverse\n\t- **C**: slinky moved with an upward pulse - transverse\n\t- **D**: slinky pushed forwards and backwards - longitudinal\n9. Mechanical waves generally travel faster in solids than in gases. Provide an explanation for this.\n   - The particles of the solid are packed closer to each other, meaning that the speed of the oscillations can be faster with same amount of energy due to the smaller distance that has to be travelled for the particles to change direction\n10. For the wave shown below, describe the direction of energy transfer of the sound between the tuning fork and point X. Justify your answer.\n\t- The direction of energy transfer is parallel to the point of the sound's origin, meaning it will move directly from the tuning fork to point X","lastmodified":"2023-02-01T21:28:13.461071256Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Physics/Waves/Wave-Definitions":{"title":"Wave Definitions","content":"\n#physics #waves\n- **Œª**: wavelength (m)\n\t- Distance between two spots on a wave where it repeats\n- **∆í**: frequency (Hz)\n\t- Cycles per second\n\t- $∆í = \\frac{1}{T}$\n- **T**: Period (s)\n\t- Time taken for 1 cycle\n- **v**: Velocity (m/s)\n\t- $v=\\frac{Œª}{T}$\n\t- $v=∆íŒª$","lastmodified":"2023-02-01T21:28:13.461071256Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/School-Subjects":{"title":"School Subjects","content":"\n## [[notes/School Subjects/English Language/English Language|English Language]]\nAn analytical lens on the language of English as we know it and how it is used to communicate thoughts and ideas\n## [[notes/School Subjects/Algorithmics/Algorithmics|Algorithmics]]\nVCE Algorithmics examines how information about the world can be systematically represented and processed, and how such processes can be made sufficiently explicit and precise that they can be implemented in a computer program through \"algorithmic thinking\"\n## [[notes/School Subjects/Physics/Physics|Physics]]\nPhysics is a natural science based on observations, experiments, measurements and mathematical analysis with the purpose of finding quantitative explanations for phenomena occurring from the subatomic scale through to the planets, stellar systems and galaxies in the Universe.\n## [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/Literature|Literature]]\nVCE Literature focuses on¬†the meaning derived from texts, the relationship between texts, the contexts in which texts are produced and read, and the experiences the reader brings to the texts.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-01T21:28:13.461071256Z","tags":null}}
