Nonetheless, our nations are built on a notion of democracy that is flawed without this freedom, the ability to be able to articulate opinions and thoughts without the fear of being censored or face legal consequences. Time and time again, this right has been used to defend hate speech, and though freedom of speech definitely gives people the right to use hate speech, as it always has done, this does not mean people are exempt from any form of retaliation.\n\nVery frequently when people say that their freedom of speech is being violated, what they actually mean is that they are upset that people do not agree with them. In no way has anyone physically stopped them from saying ludicrous or hateful things, they have just faced retaliation for the harmful messages they are spreading. Such petty individuals seemingly miss the point of the concept: they are allowed to say what they want and let people listen, but what people do when they hear the message is up to the people and the people alone.\n\nIn some extreme cases, hate speech *will* be removed, or in other words, the opinion of the speaker is being censored. This in most cases can be seen as a consequence of the impact of the message, not the idea the message carries itself. Once again, they have fully been able to voice their opinion, and it is not being silenced by some tyrannical regime, but has rather been removed due to active harm that is being caused to others. Does it not make sense that if a message online is hypothetically teaching children how to make explosives that cause property damage, it would be removed and erased? This is simply correct not because it is censoring a message of being able to defend yourself, but because it is hurting landowners and the kids it influences. There is always a line, and though the edges near that line can be blurry, someone has to be able to apply moral judgement to the outcome of messages as to prevent easily preventable actions.\n\nIn conclusion, freedom of speech is a wonderful right that should apply to us all, including allowing the use of any kind of speech. This being said, hate speech can and will be removed from certain platforms if it is actively causing harm, an image the platforms would not like to convey, and people are welcome to find other ways to express their opinions. People disagreeing with an opinion is clearly not a violation of your freedom of speech, as encouraged discourse is the whole idea behind the concept, and people of all ages should be free to form their own opinions with all information available to them.","lastmodified":"2023-02-02T11:24:36.216636448Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/English-Language/Transition-Period/Interesting-English-Language-Articles":{"title":"Interesting English Language Articles","content":"\n#englang #research\n1. The Scots Language\n\tThis is a really interesting article I found through [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP-PV9ryXM4) by xidnaf, and it talked about when a language actually becomes a different language. The line seems to be *really* blurry surprisingly.\n\t\n\tThe video mentions that linguists actually split languages by mutual intelligibility, so if people can understand each other even though some words are different or dialects/accents are different, the language is the same.\n\t\n\tThis still has its own problems though, because for example the Chinese \"languages\" are referred to as dialects even though they can't exactly understand each other, but they still use the same writing system, so you're in the weird position of they speak different languages, but they write in the same one ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯\n\t\n\tDialect Continuums are also a thing which is cool, overall there's just quite a big range. Australian people might struggle to understand British people, not a different language, but could still maybe understand a *few* loan words in Arabic or such, and the range varies such as English with German etc.\n\t\n\tIt's also not symmetrical e.g. people from Denmark can understand people from Sweden a lot better than vice versa.\n\t\n\tAll in all, what even is a different language is basically up to what we call it, and in the end it's basically all politics funnily enough.\n\t\n\tAnd now we get the Scots Language! It split from Old English similar to modern English, which was spoken about 1000 years ago in Britain. This is completely seperate to Scottish mind you, but is rather a remnant of what Old English was like.\n\t\n\tHere's a demonstration of the Scot's Language which can be found [here](https://youtu.be/cENbkHS3mnY) and helped demonstrate the concept of mutual intelligibility, which is quite common in other places but not so much for native English speakers\n\t \n\thttps://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/scots-language\n\n2.

How humans initially developed language is not wholly clear and is something that linguists are still researching. Most humans learn at least one language in early childhood. If a person lacks exposure to language as a young child, they will never be able to fluently learn a language as an adult because of how human brain development works.\n\n---\n# Definition 2\n## Source: [What is Language | IGI Global](https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/using-lean-method-in-english-language-classes/16613)\n## Definition:\nSystem for the expression of thoughts, feelings, etc., by the use of spoken sounds or convention symbols.\n\n---\n# Definition 3\n## Source: [what is language? : linguistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/bw37zc/what_is_language/)\n## Definition:\nA language is defined as a being an open system of communication. In other words, new symbols can be freely added to the system. For example, if I say that I define \"vlirsnik\" to mean \"the feeling of learning something new\" I can add it to this system of communication we are using right now and you will be able to understand it. Therefore, this is a language.\n\n---\n# What is common to your three definitions?\nAll three of the definitions mention that languages are a communication system, that try to express thoughts, ideas and feelings. They also mention that they have a common set of conventions that allow for a practically infinite set of meanings to be added.\n\n---\n# In your own words explain the word \"language\"\nA language is a set of communication standards that aim to convey meaning in the form of ideas, concepts, thoughts and feelings. This is done in a way that ideas can be added to these said conventions to be able to convey new concepts that were previously not expressible, therefore being modular in its usage.","lastmodified":"2023-02-02T11:24:36.284636337Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/Literature":{"title":"Literature","content":"\n#lit #subject \n## Unit 1\n### AoS 1: The Penelopiad\n- Read an extract from [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/A Thousand Ships Extract|A Thousand Ships]] and annotate, and then compare and contrast it with [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Calliope and the Painting|a painting]]\n- Read [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Chapters/Chapter 1|Chapter 1]] of The Penelopiad and write about how [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Atwood|Atwood]] comments on [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Culture \u0026 Society- The Penelopiad|Culture and Society]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-02T11:24:36.284636337Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/A-Thousand-Ships-Extract":{"title":"A Thousand Ships Extract","content":"\n#lit #flashwrite \n\n\u003e Comment on the author's use of tone and voice of the character Calliope in this extract.\n\nThe author makes Calliope's voice quite direct, using a lot of short clauses which comment on her own emotions and the state of the world around her. This observational tone combined with propositions such as, \"Perhaps he hasn't thought of what it is like to be me,\" allow the extract to form a clear image of how Calliope feels in the situation she describes: she is not understood and she is alone in her suffering. She questions her reality a lot, the need for it and the purpose behind it. Rhetorical questions such as, \"Can he really believe he has something new to say?\" or \"How much epic poetry does the world really need?\" all play into this narrative of it all being unnecessary, that none of it is required and is all built up on a greed for more fame and wealth and money, forgetting the true purpose behind any of in the first place.\n\nThe author also uses anaphora as a staple in Calliope's voice, utilising the repetition to highlight the monotony and \"foreverness\" of this situation. It is all a cycle, as evident by the end of the extract, and the character of Calliope embodies this, having experienced everything already. \"Every conflict joined, every war fought very city besieged, every town sacked, every village destroyed.\"","lastmodified":"2023-02-02T11:24:36.284636337Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/Atwood":{"title":"Atwood","content":"#lit #thepenelopiad #author\n\nMargeret Atwood is a Canadian writer and poet best known for her prose from a feminist perspective.

They both are conventionally beautiful, dressed with riches and money, but there is a hollowness in their eyes, because none of it really means anything.

She has been lost in the shadows for all her life, so she wants to be able to portray her side of the story, and get it all out there because she never could while she was alive.\n\nShe had to suffer so much just because of her husband, and she doesn't want others to go down the same path of suffering needlessly. She wants to be known as more than just a faithful wife, but her own person. The weaponisation of [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Penelope|Penelope's]] character not only makes them suffer more, but further excuses the behaviour of the men.\n\n\u003e Comment on the tone used here and give an example\n\nThe tone of the chapter is very sombre, and and reminiscent. She feels sad that her life never amounted to too much, but she is determined now to tell her story when she can. She says now that no one cares, that it didn't matter at all, but she's waited for so long that she can finally find a little bit of motivation because there is nothing left to lose. \n\nShe is also almost slightly resentful towards Odysseus. She talks about his characters and how she was played the fool, holding a bit of a grudge but condemning herself for not acting on it sooner. \"I turned a blind eye, I kept my mouth shut or if I opened it, I sang his praises\". This rescinded tone, where she sounds so defeated and tired doesn't see herself as anyone perfect but is rather very self critical. She talks about her blissful ignorance, but in death she realises that she was dragged through the mud, and now she wants to set the record straight. \n\n\u003e What is meant by \"A stick used to beat other women with\"?\n\nPeople weaponise [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Penelope|Penelope's]] faithfulness and use that as a measuring bar to compare other women with. So [[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Penelope|Penelope's]] faithfulness, rather than being celebrates, is used to degrade other women and further pushes the status quo that women are defined by their husbands. Keeping that loyalty was actually something that hurt her, and she doesn't want others to follow her example because it just makes the lives of others worse.","lastmodified":"2023-02-02T11:24:36.284636337Z","tags":null},"/notes/School-Subjects/Literature/The-Penelopiad/Culture-Society-The-Penelopiad":{"title":"Culture \u0026 Society- The Penelopiad","content":"#lit #flashwrite #thepenelopiad \n\n\u003e In re-writing The Penelopiad, what assumptions and ideas about culture and society is Atwood seeking to question?\n\n[[notes/School Subjects/Literature/The Penelopiad/Atwood|Atwood]] aims to question the idea that there is one true tale for the events of a story.

Describe the motion of particles within a medium as a mechanical wave passes through the medium:\n   - The particles oscillate around a mean position, allowing for energy to be transferred through them without a net transfer of matter with zero displacement\n2. Which of the following statements are true and which are false? For the false statements, rewrite them so they become true.\n\t- **A**: ~~Longitudinal~~ Transverse waves occur when particles of the medium vibrate in the opposite direction to the direction of the wave: False, needs to be transverse\n\t- **B**: Transverse waves are created when the direction of vibration of the particles is at right angles to the direction of the wave: True\n\t- **C**: A longitudinal wave is able to travel through air: True\n\t- **D**: The vibrating string of a guitar is an example of a transverse wave: True\n3.

Which one or more of the following statements made by Lee would be correct? Explain your answers.\n\t- **A**: Hearing a sound wave tells me that air particles have travelled from the speaker to me.\n\t- **\u003cmark style=\"background: #FFF3A3A6;\"\u003eB\u003c/mark\u003e**: Air particles carried energy with them as they travelled from the speaker to me.\n\t- **\u003cmark style=\"background: #FFF3A3A6;\"\u003eC\u003c/mark\u003e**: Energy has been transferred from the speaker to me.\n\t- **\u003cmark style=\"background: #FFF3A3A6;\"\u003eD\u003c/mark\u003e**: Energy has been transferred from the speaker to me by the oscillation of air particles.\n\t- Explanation: The particles do not have a net transfer of matter but do transfer energy from the speaker to Lee\n7. A mechanical wave may be described as transverse or longitudinal. In a transverse wave, how does the motion of the particles compare with the direction of travel of the wave?\n   - In a transverse wave, the motion of the particles is perpendicular to the direction of the wave \n8. Classify the waves described below as either longitudinal or transverse:\n\t- **A**: sound waves - longitudinal\n\t- **B**: a vibrating guitar string - transverse\n\t- **C**: slinky moved with an upward pulse - transverse\n\t- **D**: slinky pushed forwards and backwards - longitudinal\n9. Mechanical waves generally travel faster in solids than in gases. Provide an explanation for this.\n   - The particles of the solid are packed closer to each other, meaning that the speed of the oscillations can be faster with same amount of energy due to the smaller distance that has to be travelled for the particles to change direction\n10. For the wave shown below, describe the direction of energy transfer of the sound between the tuning fork and point X.
